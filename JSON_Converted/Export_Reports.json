Page-based formats tend to produce a more exact output. The emphasis of these formats is layout representation and formatting. Formatting refers to attributes such as font style, text color, text alignment, background color, and so on. Layout refers to object position, object size, and the relationship between these attributes and other objects. Depending on the format of the Report, it may not be possible for the program to preserve all layout and formatting perfectly, but page-based formats, in general, preserve these properties as closely as possible."
