Assembly Editing requires an understanding of the various areas that editing is possible, as well as which areas allow for Assemblies or Parts to retain their logic (I.E., stretch, etc). Editing is the process of sectioning an Assembly or object so that it acquires the look and status of the new Assembly. Typically, this is accomplished by two methods of editing. Section editing is the process where an Assembly is divided into vertical or horizontal areas that are assigned properties, such as Door, Drawer, or Roll Out. Orthographic editing is the process of adding or replacing Parts, and thereafter re-establishing intelligence, or allowing an Override on that Part to exist. These two methods also represent the \u00a0two main editing views:"

The retention of intelligence allows the edited Part or area to respond to changes in an Assemblies dimensions. Access to the \"Section Face\" view is gained via the Section   tab, and the Section Face   option."
