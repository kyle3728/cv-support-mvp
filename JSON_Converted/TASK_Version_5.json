Feed Rate, Layer Name & Pen Number from the Tool Catalog will be ignored. Tool selection will be made by Tool Number. If the Tool Number is 0, then tool selection is made by a diameter match between the tool and the operation. Since some tools are selected by matching the width of the tool and the operation, the output unit should match that of your machines tool catalog. This is typically metric."
