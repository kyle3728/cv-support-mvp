It is, in short, a box built exactly as you specified when you setup the Construction Method that is effective for the Assembly. Another advantage is that the Default Assembly sheds any unintentional overrides that may have accidentally become part of the Assembly. In practice, it is probably a good idea to begin the process of sectioning an Assembly into a unique configuration by first defaulting the Assembly."
