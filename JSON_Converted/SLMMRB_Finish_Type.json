While both exhibit a combination of Specular and Diffuse reflection, matte paints have a higher proportion of Diffuse reflection and glossy paints have a greater proportion of Specular reflection. Very highly polished surfaces, such as high quality mirrors, can exhibit almost complete Specular reflection."
