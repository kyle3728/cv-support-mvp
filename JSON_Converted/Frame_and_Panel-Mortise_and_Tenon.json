Except that before adding parts to the Door at the Construction tab you would go to  Setup | Construction Settings . \u00a0At the \"Setup Construction Defaults\" screen you would check the check box for mortise and tenon and enter the depth of the mortise and tenon you want to use. Also before adding parts to the Door make sure you do not have an Inside Edge Profile selected under \"Sample Profiles\", and that you do not select an \"Inside Edge Profile\" while at the \"Profile\" tab. After the door is created go back to \"Construction Settings\" and deselect mortise and tenon."
