However, if an Assembly is added to the Room and it is added to a Wall with a lower number, it will renumber the Assemblies within the Job. Typically,\n    Base Assemblies are numbered before Upper Assemblies. Lower numbers are on the left of a Wall, and the Upper Assemblies continue the numbering sequence that the last Base Assembly was using. If Wall #1 had 5 Assemblies, then Wall #2 would start with\n    Assembly #6, and running left to right, Base then Upper Assemblies, assign numbers to those Assemblies. The next Room will start where the previous Room left off. Deleting or adding Assemblies to an earlier Wall or Room results in renumbering of all\n    subsequent Assemblies, which can sometimes present problems. The lock Assembly Numbers feature prevents this potential problem."

Assemblies with unlocked numbers all start numbering from the lower left side of Wall #1 in Room #1 and proceed left to right, then left to right for Upper Assemblies on the same Wall,\n    and then to the next Wall following the same numbering sequence. If an Assembly is added to the Base Assemblies on Wall #1, Room #1, ALL Assemblies renumber in all subsequent Rooms. This is prevented if Assembly Numbers are locked."
