A  \"right-click\"  means to click one time with the right mouse button on the object specified. Also, you will be asked to  \"drag\"  objects with the mouse at certain times. This means that you will hold the mouse over the specified object, click and hold the left mouse button, then move the mouse while still holding the left button until you reach the area that you were instructed to move the object to. Some objects may be  \"dropped\"  by simply letting go of the left mouse button. Other objects must be  \"dropped\"  by clicking again when you reach the destination.
