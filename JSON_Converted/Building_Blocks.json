All saws should be set to output Center Line paths. Tool Number, Feed Rate, Layer Name & Pen Number from the Tool Catalog will be ignored. Tool selection is made by a diameter match between the tool and the operation. Since some tools are selected by matching the width of the tool and the operation, the output unit should match that of your machines tool catalog. This is typically metric."
