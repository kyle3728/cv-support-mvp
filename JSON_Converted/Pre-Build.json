In a case where the UCS modifies the value on an Construction Method\u00a0generated parameter, the parameter was modified (in the Object Tree), but the result was not shown in the way the Assembly was built because it was already built before the UCS modified the value. This required the user to do a Room rebuild to cause the first step of the Assembly build process to recognize the new value on the Construction Method generated parameter. By toggling ON 'Pre-Build', the value of the parameter is modified PRIOR to building the Assembly."

For example, a UCS that modifies the DX, DY, DZ, AX, AY, AZ, X, Y, or Z parameters of a Part would NOT use this toggle because these types of parameters will change the size, position, and angle of a Part as soon as the parameter is modified. However, a UCS that modifies or adds parameters such as BKTYPE, ESHAPL, ESHAPR, ETL, or ETR would require the Assembly to be rebuilt AFTER these parameters are modified. The best way to understand this is to think about what the parameter modifies. BKTYPE changes the back type, so the Assembly would need to be rebuilt according to the Construction Method questions for Unfinished or Finished back, depending upon what the BKTYPE parameter indicates the back type should be. ESHAPL and ESHAPR changes the End to go to the floor, so the Assembly would need to be rebuilt with an End that goes to the floor so that the Toe Parts that no longer belong, are removed. ETL and ETR changes the End type, which requires the Assembly to be rebuilt according to the Construction Method questions for the various types of Ends and/or other parameters (Finished, Unfinished, Applied, Applied Door, Clipped, Radius, Angled)."
