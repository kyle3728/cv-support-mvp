Models that can be imported into Solid must have unique materials distinguished BY LAYER. In the CABINET VISION import dialog, what you are seeing is not individual objects but a list of all the layers within the model. Multiple objects that use the same material are on the same layer. The majority of existing models distinguish materials by layer, but some use the other methods. In fact, it is not uncommon for models to use combinations. For instance, a model may have multiple objects on a single layer, each with a different color. CABINET VISION would import such a model with all objects being the same material: the color information is ignored."
