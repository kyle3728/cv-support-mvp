Be that object a cabinet or something you are creating from scratch like a corbel, a wood top, a can goods rack, a fireplace mantel, a store fixture of some kind, or whatever. Understanding formulas will also help you with any \"User Created Standards\" (UCS) you may wish to write. \"User Created Standards\" can do a lot, but they can do a lot more when you know a little about writing formulas. So it is going to be well worth your time to read the beginning of this document and to work your way through all the exercises presented."

We will not need to write a formula for the rotation, as once we get the part rotated into place, it will not need to rotate again. What we are going to do is start a Frameless job and place a base cabinet. Once the base cabinet is placed we will turn it into a sink cabinet. The sink cabinet will have a false front and a butt pair of doors. We will then add a part behind the false front so we can screw through it to hold the false front in place. And then we will give it intelligence by writing formulas for it placement and sizing."
