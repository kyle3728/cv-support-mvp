We could say  the Y is equal to the height of the cabinet minus the thickness of the top stretcher . Or we could say  the Y is equal to the height of the cabinet minus 3/4\" . It would be better to use the first formula because if the thickness of the top stretcher changed the first formula would take this into consideration whereas the second formula would not. We could say the Y of the BOARD is equal to  the Y of the top stretcher . If you click on the top stretcher you will note that it and the BOARD have the same up and down position. This is a good formula so we will use it. The Y of the BOARD =  the Y of the Top Stretcher . So now that we have our formula. We need to trace it through the object tree."
