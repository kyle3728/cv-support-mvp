We could say the Y is equal to  the width of the front toe  (the front toe is laying down so its \"Width\" is running up and down, not left and right)  plus the thickness of the deck . So the formula could be  width of front toe plus thickness of deck.  Or, if you click on the deck and then you click on the second BOARD you will notice that they have the same Y position. So we could say the Y of the board is equal to  the Y of the deck . We will use the second formula  the Y of the deck ."
