Negative Waste can be created when Grain Matching. \n \n \n \n \n Each cut in the figure below is considered a \u201cGap Cut\u201d; a gap cut is a cut required to maintain the gap between 2 parts. This machine\u2019s kerf is set to 1/4\u201d. Therefore the cut instruction for the 3/4\u201d gap cut would be a 1/4\u201d waste piece. When part 1A is cut it leaves a 1/2\u201d gap before 2A. To remove the 1/2\u201d the machine must cut a 1/4\u201d piece of waste (1/4\u201d waste + the 1/4\u201d kerf = the 1/2\u201d gap). \n \n \n In the figure below the 1/2\u201d and 3/8\u201d gap cuts are considered Negative Waste. Negative waste is output red because it requires special saw instructions. Using the logic described in Gap Cuts, the 1/2\u201d gap requires a 0\u201d cut and the 3/8\u201d gap requires a 1/8\u201d cut. Since the typical saw controller cannot accept either a 0 or negative cut these have to be handled with special cutting instructions. Since only some saws can process negative waste this feature is turned off by default. For saws that cannot process these instructions the negative waste gap cuts are reduced to equal the saw kerf. This would affect the 1/2\" and 3/8\u201d gaps above, but not the 3/4\" gap."
