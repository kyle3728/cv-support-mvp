If placing multiple Objects, it is a good idea to overlap the new Object on its neighbor as Solid will compensate for the Object dimensions and move your new Object so that it touches the Object it overlapped, just as if you were installing the Objects side by side. This method prevents the possibility of an error caused when placing Objects and trying to move one to the side of another, as you may be off by 1/8 or 1/4 inch, and at the scale you are working with, this small dimension may not be noticed."

Also, adding clearances to items like Dishwashers or other appliances that require less than 1 inch clearance is much easier when the appliance is dropped on its neighbor, (zero clearance) and the clearance is added to the appropriate data box (right or left clearance). This insures accurate and reliable dimensioning throughout the Job. Another tip that helps insure accuracy is to spend a moment looking at the data in these boxes after placing, editing, or moving an Object. Angle, Outset (distance from Wall) and Elevation (distance above floor) are provided in the lower data boxes above. These data boxes only appear when an Object is activated."
