Simply specify the Tool Radius to Clean Up after. Notice in the animation below that the Clean Up Cutter comes in after the initial pass and only cleans up in the Corners rather than making a complete set of passes to clean up. \n \n \n Type - Vertical & Horizontal Slats -  Vertical and Horizontal Slats are special Operation Types designed to Cut Slats allowing the creation of Shaker Style MDF doors. Specify the Distance from the Route Path to the Start/End of Slat; this keeps the Engraver used for the Slats from overlapping your perimeter. There are two options for the Slat Spacing \"Optimal\" which will vary the Slat Spacing but not exceed the Offset value and \"Fixed\" will use a Fixed value for the Slat Spacing based on the Offset value. Simply specify the Distance between the Slats in the Offset Column.0 \n \n \n Type - Finish -  The Finish Operation Type, similar to the Clean Up Operation Type, is designed to allow you to assign a Finish Tool to clean up inside radiuses on the outside of a tool path.
