Look at the tab for Associated Doors, and note the radial pattern of the Doors around the current Door in the center. If a design change is required when the current Door reaches a predetermined dimension, the new Door must be placed in the appropriate box. If the Door is to change to a Mid Rail construction above 32 inches, then a Door should be designed with a Mid Rail, and that design should be placed in the box above the current Door, and 32 inches must be entered in the data box between the two Doors."

            "data": "For example I have a square raised panel Door and I would normally not make this Door any less in height than 8 inches. Because the Top Rail is 2 inches, the Bottom Rail is 2 inches, my raised panel detail is 1 \u00bc inches all around, and I would want a flat area on the panels of no less than 1 \u00bd inches wide. This all adds up to 8 inches if I make the Door any less than 8 inches in height it gets dangerous to run the panel on my shaper."

When I am in a Job and the Door becomes less than 8 inches in height or width, CABINET VISION will automatically replace the square raised panel Door with a solid wood Door that I have in my Door Catalog. I have also set a size limit of 32 inches for the height. When I am in a job and the Door becomes taller than 32 inches CABINET VISION will automatically replace the Door with a Double Panel Door that I have in my Door Catalog."
