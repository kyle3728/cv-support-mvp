The Library Explorer functioned much as Windows Explorer in that the user was able to browse, copy, paste, delete, and rename Objects in a Library (or Catalog). Over time, more functions were added to the Library Explorer and it slowly became more of a Catalog creation and maintenance tool. Therefore, the name was changed to better reflect the functionality of this utility and the Catalog Editor was born."
