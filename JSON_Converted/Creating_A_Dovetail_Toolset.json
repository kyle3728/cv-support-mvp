For example the MultiCAM post expects Inches Per Minute but converts the final output to Inches per Second. In addition the material will have an effect on the final feed rate. When testing take into account the % feed rate property in the Material Catalog. \n \n \n Descent Rate -  This will have the same unit of measurement as feed rate. \n \n \n Spindle Speed -  This is the speed at which the tool will spin. The unit is almost always RPM  Rotations per minute. Setting a value of 0 here will usually cause an error in the G-Code. A valid range would be about 4000 to 24000. It would depend on the Machine and Tool's recommended specifications. Some Machines will ignore this number and use a preset number for a Tool."
