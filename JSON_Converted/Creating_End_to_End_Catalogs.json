Second, the manufacturer does not have to be concerned with distributing and updating all the individual database files associated with a CV Catalog. Be aware that a distributable file cannot be updated, but must be replaced when a change is made to the Catalog. Therefore, this routine must be the last function performed on a Catalog that is intended for distribution."
