There is also an option for \"skins\" for Finished Ends. It is important to understand what Skins are not. They are never plastic laminate, nor are they sheet veneer. This is because both of those items are handled in the  Material Schedules  as Horizontal and Vertical Laminate. Additionally, you may find that you have chosen Standard or another Finished End Type only to find several questions following regarding Applied Doors and/or Applied Panels."
