When writing code that sizes a part it is important to know where the reference point is.

But we already know to stay away from the ends if we can. We could say  the width of the cabinet minus 1 1/2\" , but if the thickness of the ends changed this code wouldnt work very well. Like I said earlier the easiest thing to do is find something in the cabinet that all ready has the value you need and that will change in the way you want the parameter you are working on to change."

If the thickness of ether end changes the Deck, the Top Stretchers, and the Nailers will all change size in relation to the thickness of the ends. Also, if the cabinet is stretched so that it is wider, these parts will grow. So we could use the DY of any of these parts as the DY of our board. We will use  the DY of the deck  for the DY of our BOARD. So our formula is:  the length of the deck . So now that we have our formula. We need to trace it through the object tree to get our code."
