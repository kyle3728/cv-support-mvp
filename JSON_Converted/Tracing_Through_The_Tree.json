To come up with this information you need to trace it through the Object Tree. See the following picture.

Notice that in the case of the Deck it starts at the top ( CAB ) and then it branches at  Case  so you add a period between the word  CAB  and the word  Case . Next it branches at the Deck so you add a period between  Case  and  DE  and you have  CAB.CASE.DE . From the Deck you move to the parameters in the bottom pane.  Any time you move from the top pane to the bottom pane you add a period  so you must place a period between  DE  and the parameter  DZ  (DZ = thickness which is what you are looking for) and you have  CAB.CASE.DE.DZ , which is the thickness of the Deck. So  the height of the Cabinet minus the thickness of the deck  is equal to  CAB.DY-CAB.CASE.DE.DZ ."

The second part  CAB.INTERIOR.AS.SS.DZ  leads CABINET VISION to the DZ parameter of the \"SS\" (Adjustable Shelf Strip), which has a value of 3/4 inches.
