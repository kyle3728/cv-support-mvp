The shape of the inside edge cut is not as important as the depth/width of the cut. This is because the shape of the Inside Edge cut is merely decorative while the depth/width of the cut can be used by Solid to size your door parts."

This is because Solid can add the width of the Inside Edge Profile to each end of the Top Rail, Mid Rail, Bottom Rail, and any Mid Stiles, for the cope & stick."
