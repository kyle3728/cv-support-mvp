Depending on the post-processor, Feed Rate, Tool Number & Tool Compensation may be ignored. Valid Feed Rate values are 0 - 9. Layer Name & Pen Number from the Tool Catalog are always ignored. Tool selection for boring is made by a diameter match in the tool and operation. Tool selection for saws & routers are made by either Tool Number or Tool Diameter depending on the post-processor. Since some tools are selected by matching the width of the tool and the operation, the output unit should match that of your machines tool catalog. This is typically metric."
