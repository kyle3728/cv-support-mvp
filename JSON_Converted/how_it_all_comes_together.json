Those states have multiple counties composed of multiple cities. Those cities probably have subdivisions, etc. That Country, State, County, etc. organization would be the hierarchy of the country. Now, if a change is made to a Global law, say a law covering the entire United States, it applies to all the lesser divisions below it, even the lowest subdivisions."

That would be a local law, and it would have no reach to a neighboring county, another state, etc. However it would effect the cities within it. \u00a0If you look at the United States as the Global portion of Solid, and a State as the Job portion of Solid, and the entering of data in your databases as the equivalent to the laws in the above example, then the Global, or Local reach within the hierarchy. A Setup modification made to your databases, (wizard, schedules, etc) would have maximum reach over all future Jobs. Those changes would not be required of existing Jobs. However, if they were such great changes that the existing Jobs would benefit from them, then those changes can be  IMPORTED  into Solid. If on the other hand, something less than a State, say a County in our example, then we would need to do so without effecting other neighboring counties. A county here would be like a Room in Solid. The ability to freely change Rooms to be different from other Rooms, in Material and Construction is necessary for those instances when you have an oak kitchen, with a cherry dining room, with a plastic laminate laundry room, and melamine garage cabinets in the same Job. By organizing each of these portions of the project into the appropriate Room, you have guaranteed that the Material, the Construction, the hardware, the counter tops, etc are unique and particular to that area."
