Click on the Deck and notice where the Z is. We could say it is equal to  the depth of the cabinet minus the thickness of board@2.  We could say it is equal to  the Z position of the front stretcher plus the width of the front stretcher minus the thickness of board@2.  We could say  the Z of board@2  is equal to  the Z of board@1 . I think well use this last one; the Z of board@2 is equal to the Z of board@1. When we trace the Z of board@1 through the tree it is  Cab.Board@1.Z  or just  Cab.Board.Z  we dont have to put in the \"@\" symbol for the first part in a list of similarly named parts."
