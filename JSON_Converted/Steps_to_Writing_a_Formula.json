If your formula has more than one part trace each part of the formula separately. \n \n \n The first level of the Object Tree is always \"CAB\" no matter what the name of the object is. \n \n \n Every time the tree branches add a period. \n \n \n When you step through each level of the tree add a period. \n \n \n Go back to the Part you are working on.After you have traced it through the tree and written the code down, click back on the Part you want to work on. \n \n \n Select the Parameter you want to work on. \n \n \n Select \"Edit\". \n \n \n Change from a \"Value\" to an \"Equation\". \n \n \n Write your code on the \"THEN\" line. \n \n \n Always \"Test\" your code (If possible, some code may rely on other code you havent finished writing yet.). \n \n \n Always go back and look at your assembly in 3D (at the Assembly Level) and see if it still looks OK."
