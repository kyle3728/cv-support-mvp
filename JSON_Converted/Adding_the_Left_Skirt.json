My first thought when rotating this part would be to rotate it on the Y-axis 90 (so the face was pointing to the left) and then rotate it on the X-axis +90 so that it was lying down (with the length running front to back). This would place the reference point in the right, top and back corner. However when you rotate a part in an object (cabinet or another part), you always want to try and keep the reference point as close to the left, bottom, and back corner of the object as you can. As this will cut down on the number of placement formulas you have to write. Also it doesn't really matter (in this case) if the back of this part is facing out, as the material is lumber."
