Textures will generally show through the Finish color in a Room adding the element of realism to your objects. Typically, Textures are black and white, and receive color from a Finish at the Room Level, however, this is not always the case. A Texture can be a sample of Marble, complete with the color and pattern that you choose to scan into Solid for use in your presentations. You will have to experiment with scanning in order to find the size and type of acceptable (scannable) images that do not distort when you shrink them to the size necessary to appear on a scaled Solid rendering. A hint that may help is to search for books from hobbyists who create miniature items. Examples might be doll house publications, model railroad publications, etc. Typically, the textures you will find there are created at the scale they will be rendered at, and do not need to be reduced, and do not suffer the distortion that often accompanies the reduction process."
