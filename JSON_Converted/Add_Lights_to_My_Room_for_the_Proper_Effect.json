A \"spot\" light is a much more intense light and will wash out a scene easily. We recommend switching your general lights to \"directional\" lights (blue in color) on the \"beam\" tab. Use these directional lights to fill the light in the Room and the spot light to highlight areas that you want to draw attention to. \"Spot\" lights also seem to always wash out light colored finishes, so stick with \"directional\" lights in that situation. \n \n \n Start by placing only 2 lights - one on the left pointed right, and one on the right pointed left. Set them at about eye level (60\" to 65\") and vary the angles of each. This will help to create nice shadows. Test these until you are happy, then save them in a light schedule. \n \n \n Right click on the 3D view and select  Properties  from the pop-up menu. Go to the \"Ray Trace\" tab and set you reflections it you are getting strange reflections on the floors and walls. \n \n \n If you are still getting undesirable reflections - go to the  Finishes  button in the sidebar. Here you can adjust the sheen of your Walls, Floor, and Counter Tops. \n \n \n Do all of this before you place a lot of \"extra fancy\" objects such as toasters etc. These will slow your rendering time down drastically. If you have a Job you have already done this too - just copy it to a new Room and delete the detailed items. You can save the light schedule to use in other Rooms and delete the copied Room when you are done. \n \n \n The more lights you add the slower the rendering time. So only add a few more lights to draw attention or to create an effect - such as light through a window, under counter lighting, or light in a glass cabinet."
