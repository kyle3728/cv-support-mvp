Notice that the Scenes on the current sheet in the lower portion of the sidebar shows \"Paper\" as a scene on the current sheet. This references one of the two \"spaces\" that are in drawings. The concept of \"spaces\" simply refers to what you are working in. If you are working in the paper space, as you would when making symbols, etc. you are working in real, 1\" = 1\" scale. When you change to drawing space you are in that drawing\u2019s private space. Any CAD you perform at that level is relative to the properties of that drawing. As an example, you use the dimension tool to dimension between two walls. In drawing space, the dimension would be the real world dimension based on the scale the drawing was in. If the scale were such that the walls were 48 inches apart, the dimension tool would provide 48 inches as the dimension. If you measured the same dimension in paper space, it would provide the dimension as if you had measured the same thing using a ruler on the paper."
