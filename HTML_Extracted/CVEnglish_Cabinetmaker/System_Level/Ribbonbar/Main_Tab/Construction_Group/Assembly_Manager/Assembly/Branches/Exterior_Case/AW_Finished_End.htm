  <h1>Finished End</h1>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../../../assets/images/image508.png"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">There are a few things to consider when answering the questions in the Construction Method for Finished Ends. When choosing the type of Finished End, click each option and look at the graphic. You will see that several of the End Types have a structure behind them. This structure is the Sub End. There is also an option for &quot;skins&quot; for Finished Ends. It is important to understand what Skins are not. They are never plastic laminate, nor are they sheet veneer. This is because both of those items are handled in the <a href="">Material Schedules</a> as Horizontal and Vertical Laminate. Additionally, you may find that you have chosen Standard or another Finished End Type only to find several questions following regarding Applied Doors and/or Applied Panels.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none;"/>  Remember, when this occurs, answer the questions with the &quot;What if&quot; approach. Cabinetmaker is aware that you have selected a different default End Type, yet, it remains possible to change a particular Cabinet within Cabinetmaker to have an Applied Door or Applied Panel, and in that event, the information would be necessary.</p>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Finished End Conditions</h3>
  <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">Standard and Panelized Ends</h4>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">These end types will follow the Assembly Wizard settings for Finished Ends</p>
  <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">Applied End and Applied Doors</h4>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">These types of Finished Ends consist of two parts - a Sub End and a Finished End (or a DOR for an Applied Door). The Sub End part will follow the Assembly Wizard settings for a Sub End, while the Finished End (or DOR) part will follow the Assembly Wizard settings for a Finished End.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The internal Parts (Top, Stretchers, Deck, Nailers, etc.) will respond to Sub End standards where applicable.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">It is important to note that if the Sub Ends have a specified inside scribe amount, this could cause the Applied Part (the Finished End or DOR) to extend beyond the outside of the Cabinet.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">The Front Toe, Side Toe, and Back Toe will respond to Finished End Assembly Wizard settings.</p>
  <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">Skinned and Laminated Ends</h4>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">These types of Finished Ends are also made up of two Parts: an Unfinished End and a Skin (SLF/SRF) or Laminate (LAMV). These types of Ends are considered to be a single part by the Assembly Wizard and are treated as Finished Ends.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">All internal Parts (Top, Stretchers, Deck, Nailers, etc.) will respond to the Finished End Assembly Wizard standards.</p>
