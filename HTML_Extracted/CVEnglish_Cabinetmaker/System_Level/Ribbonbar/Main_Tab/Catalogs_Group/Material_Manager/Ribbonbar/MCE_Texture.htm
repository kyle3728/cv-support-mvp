  <h1><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image66.png"/> Textures</h1>
  <p>A Texture is a pattern that will appear on your finished objects such as wood grain or any other visible feature. Textures will generally show through the Finish color in a Room adding the element of realism to your objects. Typically, Textures are
    black and white, and receive color from a Finish at the Room Level, however, this is not always the case. A Texture can be a sample of Marble, complete with the color and pattern that you choose to scan into Cabinetmaker for use in your presentations.
    You will have to experiment with scanning in order to find the size and type of acceptable (scannable) images that do not distort when you shrink them to the size necessary to appear on a scaled Cabinetmaker rendering. A hint that may help is to search
    for books from hobbyists who create miniature items. Examples might be doll house publications, model railroad publications, etc. Typically, the textures you will find there are created at the scale they will be rendered at, and do not need to be
    reduced, and do not suffer the distortion that often accompanies the reduction process.</p>

  <h2>Toolbar</h2>
  <p>The toolbar has the following options:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image69.png"/> Import Image -</span>  Allows you to Import an image as a new Texture. See The Bitmap Method below for more information.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image70.png"/> Delete -</span> Allows you to Delete the selected Texture.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="List_View" id="List_View"></a><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image71.png"/> List View -</span> Switches the Working Area to List View, as shown in the illustration above.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image68.png"/> Thumbnail View -</span> Switches the Working Area to Thumbnail View, as shown in the illustration below.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image72.png"/></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> To edit the Properties of a Texture in Thumbnail View simply double click the Texture or right click the Texture and select Properties.
    You will be presented with the following Properties window.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 120px;"><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image73.png"/></p>

  <h2>Working Area (List View)</h2>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image67.png"/></p>
  <p>Following are the Texture Properties available in the Working Area (List View):</p>
  <ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name -</span> The Name of the Texture (This value can be edited).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> - The Description of the Texture (This value can be edited).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Path -</span> The Path to the file the Texture is using (This value can not be edited).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decal -</span> If Enabled this will instruct the System to not blend the Finish with the Texture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tile -</span> If Enabled instructs the System to repeat Texture at the specified World Width/World Height across the surface it is being applied to.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">World Width -</span> The Width the image should represent in a real-world dimension.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">World Height -</span> The Height the image should represent in a real-world dimension.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;"><a name="The_Bitmap_Method" id="The_Bitmap_Method"></a>The Bitmap Method</p>
  <p>Here, a new Texture created using the Paint program that ships with Microsoft Windows™ will be imported for use as speaker cloth on Doors for a Job. The Texture was created in the favored 200 by 200 pixel size, and saved as a Bitmap file to the C:\Cabinet
    Vision\Solid_11\Database\Graphics folder as spk.bmp.</p>
  <p>To add a Texture choose the Category where you want it located then click the New option in the ribbonbar and select the Bitmap or JPG file from the Graphics sub-folder where you saved the file you made. Files that you copy to your computer can be saved
    to the same folder as those you make and imported in the same fashion.</p>
  <p>Since this is a file that exists on my computer I will choose the &quot;Load an image from a file&quot; option in the toolbar.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image74.png"/></p>
  <p>Browse to, and select you image file then click Open.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image75.png"/></p>
  <p>Go ahead and fill out all the Properties, when you are happy with the Properties click the Save option in the toolbar.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image76.png"/></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none;"/>  The <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;Decal&quot;</span> check box, must be checked if you want the Texture to stand alone,
    I.E., not to be tinted by the Room Finish.</p>
  <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;Tile&quot;</span> check box should be checked if you want the pattern to repeat on your object. Without checking this box, the Texture will appear one time, and may not cover all the surfaces you have applied
    it to. Make sure to set the World Width and World Height at 12 each. After verifying the appearance of your new Texture you can adjust these World dimensions to tweak the appearance of the Texture when displayed.</p>
  <p>To add this Texture to a Door as speaker cloth, create the speaker cloth as a &quot;<a href="Properties/Material_Types/SLMM_Miscellaneous.htm">Miscellaneous</a>&quot; Material in the <a href="../SL_Material_Manager.htm">Material Manager</a>, and choose
    the new Texture for the face Texture. From the <a href="../../Material_Schedule_Manager/MS_Doors.htm">Door Material Schedules</a>, create a Schedule referencing the Material as one with speaker cloth (Birch/Spker) and assign the speaker cloth to the &quot;Flat
    Panel&quot; category. You will see the following if viewed in High Detail in a Job. Note how the speaker cloth is not tinted by the Cabinet color and how the pattern repeats to fill each Door.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" height="516" src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/image878.bmp" style="border: none;" width="747"/></p>
  <p>The ultimate secret to successful Texture creation and usage is to experiment with the resolution and scale of the items you chose to use. You will quickly understand the relationship and how to improve the image after viewing your Textures in a practice
    Job. Textures are not limited to patterns, even company logos, initials, etc..., can be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> Textures can also be added from within a Job in the 3D View when selecting Textures to use in your Room or Assembly.</p>
