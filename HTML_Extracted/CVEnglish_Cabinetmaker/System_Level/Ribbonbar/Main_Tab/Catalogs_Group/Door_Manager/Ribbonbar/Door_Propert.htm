  <h1>Ribbonbar</h1>
  <p>Following are the ribbonbar options in the Door Properties area:</p>
  <h3><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image228.png"/> Return</h3>
  <p>This option will return you to the <a href="">Door Manager</a>.</p>
  <h3><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image229.png"/> New</h3>
  <p>The New option allows you to create a New Door in the Door Properties area. See the <a href="">Door Manager New</a> topic for more information.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image239.png"/></p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none; margin-left: 80px;"/> The new Door will be placed in the same Category as the currently selected Door.</p>
  <h3><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image240.png"/> Copy</h3>
  <p>Allows you to Copy the currently selected Door.</p>
  <h3><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image242.png"/> Delete</h3>
  <p>Allows you to Delete the currently selected Door. After clicking the Delete option you will be prompted to Confirm the Delete operation.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image259.png"/></p>
  <h3><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image260.png"/> Select</h3>
  <p>Allows you to Select a different Door to work with in Door Properties.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image261.png"/></p>
  <p>The sidebar in the Select Material window allows you to <a href="">Search</a> for a Door or browse for Doors via the Door Categories. Once you have located your Door simply select it from the list of Doors in the Work Area and click OK.</p>
  <h3><a id="Door_Associations"></a><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image262.png"/> Associations</h3>
  <p>Doors that should change Construction style based on pre-determined size requirements or conditions require Associations.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image263.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;"/></p>
  <p>In the above illustration we have established minimum and maximum sizes for the Square Raised Panel Door.</p>
  <p>For example I have a square raised panel Door and I would normally not make this Door any less in width or length than 8 inches. Because the Top Rail is 2 inches, the Bottom Rail is 2 inches, my raised panel detail is 1 ¼ inches all around, and I would want a flat area on the panels of no less than 1 ½ inches wide. This all adds up to 8 inches if I make the Door any less than 8 inches in height it gets dangerous to run the panel on my shaper.</p>
  <p>When the Square Raised Panel Door is used and the Width or Length of the Door is 8&quot; or less then the Solid Wood Door Style is used.</p>
  <p>When the Width is greater than 8&quot; but 23.999&quot; or less then the Square Raised Panel is used.</p>
  <p>When the Width is greater than 24&quot; but 41.999&quot; or less then the Vertical Split Raised Panel is used.</p>
  <p>When the Length is greater than 8&quot; but 31.999&quot; or less then the Square Raised Panel is used.</p>
  <p>When the Length is greater than 32&quot; but 63.999&quot; or less then the Square Raised Panel is used.</p>
  <p>And anything 42&quot; wide and 64&quot; long or larger will be a Slab (plywood).</p>
  <p>So using Associations I have set a size limit of 8 inches for the length and the width. When I am in a Job and the Door becomes 7.999 inches or less in length or width, CABINET VISION will automatically replace the Square Raised Panel Door with the Solid Wood Door. I have also set a size limit of 32 inches for the length. When I am in a job and the Door becomes 32 inches or taller CABINET VISION will automatically replace the Door with a Vertical Split Raised Panel Door.</p>
  <p>In situations where the left and right Doors should mirror each other, use the <strong>Mirrored Right Style</strong> option to assign an alternate Right Door Style to use. Simply create both the Left and Right versions of the Door. Then select the left Door and assign the right Door here. When you choose the left Door as your default Door in a Job, the Mirrored Right Style Door will thereafter be used when right hinging is called for.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image264.png"/></p>
  <h3><a id="Material_Filter"></a><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image265.png"/> Material Filter</h3>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image266.png"/></p>
  <p>Material Filters are not required but are a good option if you want to limit what Materials are available for the current Door Style. Simply add any of the Available Materials on the left to the list on the right. You will note in the illustration above that I have selected my &quot;Alder&quot;, &quot;Ash&quot;, &quot;Birch&quot;, &quot;Cherry&quot;, &quot;Maple&quot;, &quot;Oak&quot;, and &quot;Paint Grade&quot; Material Schedules for use with this Door.</p>
  <p>The Material Cost associated with the selected Material Schedule is also displayed and can be edited from here. See the <a href="">Door/Drawer Fronts Material Schedule</a> topic for more information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3><a id="Profile_Filter"></a><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image267.png"/> Profile Filter</h3>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image268.png"/></p>
  <p>Profile Filters are not required but are a good option if you want to limit what Profiles are available for the current Door Style. Simply add any of the Available Profiles on the left to the list on the right. When you start a new Job, you will select the Door at the Job Properties tab and it should give you the opportunity at that time to select the profiles that will be used in that particular Job from the Profiles that you have made available for that Door.</p>
  <p>Simply select the Profile Type to see the list of that type.</p>
  <p><span>There are four different types of profiles.</span></p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image269.png"/> <span>Inside Edge -</span> The <a href="">Inside Edge</a> is used when you have a frame around the Door and the frame is assembled with cope &amp; stick construction. Inside Edges are important because they can, depending on the Extended Property, affect the size of your Door parts.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image270.png"/> <span>Outside Edge -</span> The <a href="">Outside Edge</a> is a shape you will cut around the outside of the Door. Outside Edges do not affect the size of your Door parts.</p>
  <p><strong><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image271.png"/> Raised </strong><span>Panel -</span> The <a href="">Raised Panel</a> is the shape you will cut along the outside of the Door panel. Usually done around the edges of a Raised Panel. Panel details do not affect your Door parts sizes.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image272.png"/> <span>Route -</span> The <a href="">Route</a> is the shape of the cutter you would use if you where going to route a design into the face of the Door using a Door jig.</p>
  <p>The Profile Cost associated with the selected Profile is also displayed and can be edited from here.</p>
