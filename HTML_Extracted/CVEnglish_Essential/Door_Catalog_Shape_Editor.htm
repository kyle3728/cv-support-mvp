  <h1>Door Catalog Shape Editor</h1>
  <p>The Door Catalog Shape Editor consists of several tools designed to allow editing of Door Rails, Door Routes, and Door Profiles.</p>
  <h2><a name="AddAPoint" id="AddAPoint"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1366.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;"/> Add Points</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12pt;">Selecting this tool allows for additional points to be added to your object. Adding points allows for defining shapes by introducing new sides, or splitting sides into more than one element. When a point is added it appears as a yellow dot on the object. These yellow dots will be joined by a dashed line that represents a side. Additional dots mean more sides.</p>
  <h2><a name="DeleteAPoint" id="DeleteAPoint"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1367.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;"/> Delete Points</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;">This tool functions opposite of the Add Point Tool. When selected, each point that is clicked on will be deleted.</p>
  <h2><a name="EditPointMovePoint" id="EditPointMovePoint"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1368.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 22px;"/> Move Points</h2>
  <p>This tool allows existing points to be moved to a new position on your object. Click on the point and release the button, as the point will become your cursor. Re-position the point and click again to set it in its new position. Be careful not to cross other lines when editing the position of a point. If a point on the left end is moved to the right end, it will destroy the shape of an Object, and probably result in the loss of the Object. Points can be moved anywhere along the dashed line UNTIL they reach their neighboring yellow point. If it is necessary to move the dot beyond its neighbor, it is better to delete the current point, and create a new one in the proper area.</p>
  <p>Another feature that will accomplish the same purpose as this tool and do it more precisely, is accessed by right clicking on the yellow point.</p>
  <p>The following menu appears:</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1369.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 284px;"/></p>
  <p>The Point Position area allows you to control the position of the point by inputting the position of the point along two axes. In this example, the point is located at &quot;0&quot; Y Offset from the Reference Point, which equates to the bottom of the Object, and 300mm X offset, equating to a Length of 300mm. This point happens to be the lower right corner of a Door Route. That corner is &quot;0&quot; inches from the bottom, and 300mm from the right. Either of those values could be changed and that change would result in the Door Route changing size in response to the data that was entered in the box. This is a very accurate method of positioning points.</p>
  <h2><a name="ParallelLine" id="ParallelLine"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1370.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 18px;"/> Parallel Line</h2>
  <p>This tool allows two adjacent points to be  moved at the same time. When selected, the yellow position dots will disappear from the corners, and reappear in the middle of lines that are eligible for the parallel move option. Click the yellow dot, and move the line to the new position and click again to set it.</p>
  <h2><a name="ArcLine" id="ArcLine"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1371.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 22px;"/> Arc Line</h2>
  <p>This tool will create a new point when it is clicked on a dashed line. The point can then be pulled and as it does so, an arc will appear between the two reference points adjacent to the area you have clicked. By observing the data boxes in the sidebar, you will see the offset of your arc. This arc starts and ends at the adjoining points, so creative use of the points can create an edge that arcs out, then in, etc.</p>
  <h2><a name="RadiusPoint" id="RadiusPoint"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1372.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 24px;"/> Radius Points</h2>
  <p>This tool will radius an existing point on an object. When selected, the menu prompts for the value to use for the radius. The entered value becomes the radius of the arc. When using this tool it is important to select the radius value so that the tangent points do not cross over, or position themselves on, the neighboring yellow points. This is clearly visible when using this tool.  If they do cross, click the same point that applied the radius to and select a smaller radius.</p>
  <h2><a name="ChangeReferencePoint" id="ChangeReferencePoint"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1373.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;"/> Reference Point</h2>
  <p>Occasionally, you may need to change the location of the reference point in an object you are editing. This feature will allow that point to be changed to one of the other points by simply clicking on the new selection. Changing the reference point is typically only temporary during editing and then returns to it&#39;s default position after editing is complete.</p>
  <h2><a name="ShowSampleProfile" id="ShowSampleProfile"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1384.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 22px;"/> Show Sample Profile</h2>
  <p>This tool shows a sample Door Profile to help orient you when creating the different Door Profile Types. Typically, you would utilize this tool to orient yourself prior to Shaping then turn it Off to create/edit your Door Profile.</p>
  <h2><a name="Show_HideLines" id="Show_HideLines"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1374.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;"/> Show/Hide Lines</h2>
  <p>This Tool is available when creating/editing Custom Routes in the Door Catalog. You can use this option to turn off certain Lines in your Route Shape that would not actually be Routed. Because a Route Shape has to be one continuous line this allows you to turn off certain sections of it.</p>
  <h2><a name="ScaleImage" id="ScaleImage"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1376.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 13px;"/> Scale Image</h2>
  <p>This tool is made available in the Door Profile Catalog when Importing a bitmap. This tool allows you to scale the bitmap to fit the overall Thickness/Height of your Profile.</p>
  <h2><a name="AlignImage" id="AlignImage"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1377.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 16px;"/> Align Image</h2>
  <p>This tool is made available in the Door Profile Catalog when Importing a bitmap. This tool allows you to align the bitmap to the Origin of your Profile.</p>
  <h2><a name="LockPoints" id="LockPoints"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1375.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 16px;"/> Lock Points</h2>
  <p>This tool allows you to lock a selected point. Locking a Point can be utilized to restrict stretching/shrink when CABINET VISION attempts to re-size the Shape. Clicking on a Point with this Tool selected will bring up the following screen.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1378.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 251px;"/></p>
  <p>You can Lock the selected point both Horizontally and Vertically. For example if I select a Point to lock Left Horizontally the Length of the line from the Left-most point to the selected point would remain fixed and any stretch/shrink required would appear to the right of this point.</p>
  <h2><a name="ShowGrid" id="ShowGrid"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1379.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 22px;"/> Show Grid</h2>
  <p>This tool allows you to turn on/off the display of the Grid.</p>
  <h2><a name="SnapToGrid" id="SnapToGrid"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1380.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 25px;"/> Snap To Grid</h2>
  <p>This tool turns on the option to Snap to the Grid lines.</p>
  <h2><a name="GridUnitBox" id="GridUnitBox"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1381.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 75px;"/> Grid Unit Box</h2>
  <p>Allows for resetting the pattern size and snap precision of the Grid.</p>
  <h2><a name="ZoomIn" id="ZoomIn"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1382.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 23px;"/> Zoom Window</h2>
  <p>This tool allows you to Zoom In.</p>
  <h2><a name="ZoomOut" id="ZoomOut"></a><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1383.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 23px;"/> Zoom Out</h2>
  <p>This tool incrementally Zooms Out your image.</p>
