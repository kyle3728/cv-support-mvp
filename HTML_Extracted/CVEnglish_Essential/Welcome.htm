  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;">Adding Intelligence to a Manually Placed Part</p>
  <p>Writing formulas is like anything else you want to learn to do. You need to know a few basics and then you need to practice, practice, and practice some more. You must invest the time to read this document, and to work through all the sample exercises in the sequence presented. If you will invest the time and do the exercises, you will learn to write formulas. Writing formulas is actually fairly simple and very logical.</p>
  <p>First you figure out what it is you are trying to do and you write it down, this is your &quot;formula&quot;. Believe it or not, this is the hard part. We know how to do what we want to do; we just have never had to write it down in a logical way.</p>
  <p>Second you trace what you have written down through the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Object Tree</span> to get your &quot;code&quot;, this is the easy part.</p>
  <p>The ability to write formulas will open an exciting, new world of things you can do with CABINET VISION.</p>
  <p>In order to add intelligence to a manually placed part you are going to need to know a little about the following subjects:</p>
