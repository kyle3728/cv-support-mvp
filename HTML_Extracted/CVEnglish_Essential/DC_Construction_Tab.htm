  <h1>Construction</h1>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Click on the other tabs below for more information on them</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/image4877.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 629px;"/></p>
  <p>This tab allows access to the Construction Options. This is where your Door will be designed by adding Stiles and Rails if required, as well as modifying their size, shape, and joinery.</p>
  <p>The idea behind this tab is that you would add Stiles and Rails, if that were the type of Door you are working on. And then you would click on each Part (Stiles, Rails, Panel) one at a time and make sure that they are the size you would cut them if you were going to make this sample size Door. Solid will then use these sample Part sizes to give you the correct cut-list for whatever size Doors your Job requires.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 32px;"/></span> When entering the sample Part sizes you should enter finished Part sizes not rough cut Part sizes. The exception being, that some parts have an &quot;Extra box, so you can add in an extra amount to the Part.</p>
  <p>If you are buying your Doors you don’t need to worry about the Parts being the correct size. Just make the Door look like the Door you want.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 32px;"/></span> See the <a href="DC_Use_Door_Template.htm">Use Door Template</a> topic for information on configuring MDF Doors for the MDF Door Maker option.</p>
  <h2>Panel Type</h2>
  <p>The first step on the &quot;Construction&quot; tab would be to click in the middle of the Door and select the &quot;Type&quot; of panel for your Door. In the screen below I have selected &quot;Raised Panel&quot; as the type of panel for this Door.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Door_Catalog/Door_Catalog_Tabs/Construction_Tab/Panel_Type.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 563px;"/></p>
  <p>You can also right click in the middle of the Door to select the panel type.</p>
  <p>By selecting &quot;Raised Panel&quot; as my panel type, I have performed two functions. First I have told CABINET VISION I want this Panel to be a Raised Panel &quot;Type&quot; Panel. And second I have told CABINET VISION that I want to make this Panel out of whatever Material I selected for &quot;Raised Panel&quot; when I filled out my <a href="../../../Material_Schedule_Manager/SLMSM_Doors.htm">Door Material Schedules</a>.</p>
  <p>There are seven panel types to choose from</p>
  <ul style="list-style: square;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Raised Panel</span> – most commonly used for solid lumber.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flat Panel</span> – most commonly used for thin plywood or thin panel stock.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Glass panel</span> – most commonly used for glass.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Horizontal Slats</span> – most commonly used for tambour Doors with the slats going left and right. If you never use this type of panel you could assign it as cloth or some other Material that you do use.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><a name="None_Panel" id="None_Panel"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">None</span> - Most commonly used if your Door has no Panel and consists only of Stiles and Rails.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vertical Slats</span> – most commonly used for tambour door with the slats going up and down. If you never use this type of panel you could assign it as cloth or some other Material that you do use.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slab</span> – most commonly used for thick plywood or thick panel stock.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>With the panel highlighted by clicking on it, the Door Properties in the sidebar display the width and height of the panel. Additionally, you may change the amount of inset the Panel has. Panel Inset is that portion of the panel which fits into the Stile and Rail. The values you enter here is the overall inset.</p>
  <h3>Horizontal Grain</h3>
  <p>This option is only available when the panel is highlighted. The default value is vertical grain. Selecting Yes in this box will change the panel to horizontal grain.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Panel Height/Width Locking</p>
  <p>The dimensions may be set for a Door panel and remain fixed throughout the Job, regardless of Door size if the panel is locked. In order to lock a panel dimension, there must be a minimum of two panels in the same plane (horizontal or vertical) and one panel must remain unlocked.</p>
  <h2>Stiles &amp; Rails</h2>
  <p>The second step is to add Stiles and Rails. To do this simply use the tools above the Door.</p>
  <p>The order in which you add the parts determines their joinery. If you add the Rails before the Stiles, the Rails will run long.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Door_Catalog/Door_Catalog_Tabs/Construction_Tab/Stiles_Rails.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 579px;"/></p>
  <p>If you choose, you can miter the Stiles and Rails by enabling the &quot;Miter Corners&quot; option.</p>
  <h2>Checking the Door Panel Size</h2>
  <p>The third, and most important, step is to check your Part sizes.</p>
  <p>In the picture below I have clicked on the panel. If I were making this Door I would make the finished size of the panel 19 5/8&quot; wide by 25 5/8&quot; long for the sample Door size of 24&quot; by 30&quot; shown. You will notice that CABINET VISION calculated the size of the panel as 19&quot; by 25&quot; in the grayed out information boxes, this is the inside measurement of the frame. CABINET VISION always starts out making the panel the inside measurement of the frame. I then added 5/8&quot; to this so the panel can set into the frame 5/16&quot; on each edge.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Door_Catalog/Door_Catalog_Tabs/Construction_Tab/Panel_Size.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 577px;"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Lock Height</p>
  <p>If your Door has more than one panel, there is an option called &quot;Lock Panel&quot;. This option allows you to lock the height of a panel so that when you are in a Job the locked panel will remain the same size when the Door grows or shrinks in height.</p>
  <p>Once you have checked the part sizes for the sample Door. The next step is to click on the &quot;Profile&quot; tab and select the Profiles you wish to use with this Door.</p>
  <h2>Checking the Door Rail Size</h2>
  <p>In the picture below I have clicked on the Top Rail. If I were making this Door the finished size of the Bottom Rail would be 2 ½&quot; wide and 19 13/16&quot; long for the sample Door size of 24&quot; by 30&quot; shown. You will notice that the length of the Rail says &quot;Length&quot;+ &quot;Extra&quot; These two measurements must add up to the overall length of the finished Rail plus any extra for trim. You will notice that Solid already calculated the length of the Bottom Rail in the grayed out information box. Solid took the width of the Door (24&quot;) and subtracted the two Stiles 2 1/2&quot; x 2 = 5&quot; and came up with 19&quot; it then added on the Inside Edge Profile width to each end of the Rail 2 x 3/8&quot; = 3/4&quot;, 19&quot; + 3/4&quot; = 19 3/4&quot;.  I then added 1/16&quot; in the &quot;Extra&quot; box as I trim 1/32&quot; off of each end when I run the Rail through the shaper, for a total of 19 13/16&quot; in length. Don’t forget to check the &quot;Width&quot; The &quot;Width&quot; + &quot;Extra&quot; must add up to the overall width of the finished Stile.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Door_Catalog/Door_Catalog_Tabs/Construction_Tab/Door_Rail_Size.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 576px;"/></p>
  <p>The reason CABINET VISION was able to automatically add in the width of the Inside Edge Profile is that I picked a sample Profile from the sample Profile information box, in the sidebar, before I started checking the part sizes.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../../assets/images/image4878.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 183px;"/></p>
  <h2>Checking the Door Stile Size</h2>
  <p>In the next picture I have clicked on the Left Stile. If I were making this Door, the finished size of the Left Stile would be 2 1/2” wide and 30” long for the sample Door size of 24” by 30” shown. You will notice that the width of the Stile says &quot;Width&quot; + &quot;Extra&quot; these two measurements must add up to the overall width of the finished Stile, if your Profile is not set as applied. The edge it is talking about is your &quot;Inside Edge Profile&quot;. Your Inside Edge Profile is the route or shape you are going to cut on the inside of the Stile.</p>
