  <p>The Lights button, available in the sidebar, will give you an overhead view of the current design with the light showing (red/blue/light blue/orange) in relationship to where it is currently placed. Simply select the Light in the view to set it&#39;s Properties. The best thing to do with lighting is to experiment with it to see what works best for you.</p>

  <p><a name="Automatic_lighting" id="Automatic_lighting"></a>The Automatic lighting should be <a href="../../Introduction/The_CV_Button/Preferences.htm#Lights">setup</a> to place at least the following two Lights in every Room:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: square;">
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">The Sun Light, which is a directional light placed in the southwest corner of the scene.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">The Center Light, which is a Point Light placed in the Center of the Scene..</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are other Lights that can be placed in the Room automatically, if they are <a href="../../Introduction/The_CV_Button/Preferences.htm#Lights">enabled</a>, as your design changes.</p>
  <ul style="list-style: square;">
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">Corner Light, a</span> Directional Light in the southeast corner of the Scene.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">Door and/or Window Spotlight added directly behind a Wall that has one or more Windows or Doors in it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">Wall Corner Light added where two walls meet and there are Assemblies present.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">Wall Spotlight added 12&quot; below the Height of the Wall at the middle of a Wall that is up to 300&quot; long, two lights evenly spaced to anything longer. Wall Ends are ignored.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;">Wall Spotlight added 30&quot; above a Peninsula Wall at the middle of the Peninsula Wall that is up to 300&quot; long, two lights evenly spaced to anything longer. Wall Ends are ignored.</span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can modify the settings for any of these Automatic Lights and your changes will be preserved. If you would like to have your own Light Schedule for the Job you can click the New or Copy button in the toolbar.</p>
  <p>To adjust a light, select it by clicking on it. It will be highlighted with a dashed outline when it is selected. Now you can move it anywhere in the view port or change any of the Light, Beam, or Direction specifications available to that particular type of Light.</p>
  <p>You also have the ability to add or delete lights with the Add/Delete <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image6199.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 51px;"/> buttons and to save different lighting setups to the Light Schedule. These lighting schedules are specific to the job you are currently working in.</p>
  <h2>Light Properties</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image2543.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 177px;"/></p>
  <h3>Enabled</h3>
  <p>A light can be temporarily shut off by setting Enabled to No.</p>
  <h3>Color</h3>
  <p>The Color list lets you tint the light to simulate different types of light sources, such as White Light (whitish), Sky Light (bluish), Sun Light (yellowish), Fluorescent (greenish), or Incandescent (orangish). You can just use White Light (the default setting for a new light), but if you want to give your scene a little more color, try experimenting with the other color settings. The more lights you set to a particular color, the more pronounced that color will be. There are also pure color lights available (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Violet) if you want a color to be more pronounced.</p>
  <h3>Brightness</h3>
  <p>Brightness is your most important setting and controls the overall intensity of the light.</p>
  <h2>Beam Properties</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image2544.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 177px;"/></p>
  <p>The Beam Properties area will allow you to set up the type of light beam that you will need for the effect you are looking for. These properties are not available for the Ambient or the Head lights.</p>
  <h3>Type</h3>
  <p>There are three Light types:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spot -</span> Appears as a red circle and projects a cone-like beam of light.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Directional -</span> Appears as a blue circle and projects a wide parallel beam of light as if from a distant source.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Point" id="Point"></a>Point -</span> Appears as a light blue circle and acts as a ball of light projecting light in all directions. This is the most versatile or all light types.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Height</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">This setting allows you to set the Height of a Spot or Point Light. Height is not an option for a Directional Light.</p>
  <h3>Angle</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">If you have the light set as a spot light, you will be able to control the angle of the light-cone it creates. The tighter the cone, the more intense the light will be and the stronger the shadows.</p>
  <h3>Cast Shadows</h3>
  <p>Unlike the real world, it is possible to set whether a light casts shadows or not. Sometimes if you are just using a light to fill in a dark part of a scene, you may not want that light to cast a distinct shadow. The fewer lights casting shadows, the faster your scene will render.</p>
  <h3>Softness</h3>
  <p>This setting affects the sharpness of the spotlight cone and the shadows that are cast.</p>
  <p>In Ray-Trace rendering, if you have the Beam Softness set to zero and you have the Ray-Trace Sharp Shadows flag turned on, then you will generate a very sharp detailed shadow. In general, you will get more natural looking lighting with the normal soft shadows.</p>
  <h2>Direction Properties</h2>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image2545.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 177px;"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12pt;">The Direction Properties are not available for Point Lights.</p>
  <h3>Vertical</h3>
  <p>This setting allows you to set the Vertical Angle of your Light. You can also click the action button in the Vertical field to get the Angle window. By grabbing the &quot;nose&quot; of the light you can adjust its vertical angle.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image6200.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 296px;"/></p>
  <p>Once you get the light pointing in any direction, other than straight down, it will also have a handle in the Light Editor which you can drag to control where it is pointing.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Horizontal</p>
  <p>This setting allows you to set the Horizontal Angle of your Light. Your Light has to have a Vertical Angle set to anything other than -90 for the Horizontal field to be available.</p>
  <h2><a id="Geometry_Properties"></a>Geometry Properties</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image6529.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 159px;"/> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image6528.gif" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 159px;"/></p>
  <p>The Geometry Properties allow you to indicate if the Light Source is actual physically visible. For Spot and Point Lights you establish the Radius and for Directional Lights you establish its Width and Length.</p>

  <h2>Advanced Lighting</h2>
  <p>Lighting is the main thing you will need to spend time with in order to use Photovision to its full potential. Before you continue into this section, make sure you are familiar with the previous section on how to select, move, and adjust light settings.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Planning your Lighting</p>
  <p>Good lighting requires a little common sense plus a bit of creativity. Before you start adding lights to your scene, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Primary Light Sources</p>
  <p>What is the primary sources of light in your design? Lights, windows etc...</p>
  <ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Is the sun shining through a window?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Are there light fixtures within your scene?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">What &quot;time of day&quot; is it?</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Sources</p>
  <p>Are there any logical sources of light beyond the bounds of you room?</p>
  <p>Are there sources of ambient or reflected light?</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">For each Light Source</p>
  <ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Is it near or far away?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Is it hard and directional or soft and diffuse?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Does it cast any noticeable shadow?</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Is it direct light or light reflected off walls and floor.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Sources of Inspiration</p>
  <p>Look at magazines and pictures of rooms. You may even want to create a collection of rooms with different types of lighting situations.  Try to figure out the light sources in those pictures and practice copying those effects in Photovision. With a little bit of practice you&#39;ll be amazed at how much your renderings will improve.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;"> </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;">Types of Lights</p>
  <p>Following are the types of lights you can use in your scene.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Spot Lights</p>
  <p>Spot Lights (red circle) cast a strong cone of light. The narrower the beam angle, the more intense the light and the more intense the shadow it casts.  The angle of the beam ranges from 0 to 180 degrees. A setting of below 90 degrees casts a strong shadow while a setting of 180 casts virtually no shadow. The Beam Softness setting affects the softness of the shadows a spot light casts, as well as the fuzziness of the spot light cone. Spot lights are most useful to shine light through windows or to simulate Can Lights or Lights flush to the Ceiling.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Directional Lights</p>
  <p>Directional lights (blue circle) simulate light coming from a long distance away. It projects a wide parallel beam of light and, at high brightness settings, casts a strong shadow. Though directional lights do not project a cone of light, the Beam Softness setting does affect the softness of the shadows it casts. Use directional lights to fill large areas.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 32px;"/></span> It does not matter where a directional light is placed in the scene; only the direction it is pointing. Even if the directional light is in the Room, it will cast shadows as if it is far outside the Room. It also can&#39;t shine through walls.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Point Lights</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Point Lights (light blue circle) are the most common form of artificial Lighting in the real world. It most accurately simulates a light bulb as it casts light in all directions from its placement.</p>
  <h2> </h2>
  <h2>Lighting Setup</h2>
  <p>The following topics cover some basic lighting setups.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">The &quot;Top&quot; Light</p>
  <p>At the beginning of a Photovision project, you will start with a single point light centered above your scene. If the light is too close to any wall, move it out further so the light can better angle in toward the fronts of your cabinets. A light in this position is referred to as a &quot;Center&quot; light.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">The &quot;Key&quot; Light</p>
  <p>To give your rendering more contrast, it is a good idea to add another light, in addition to the &quot;Center&quot; light, coming in from the side.  This light is referred to as the &quot;Key&quot; light, or primary light source in the scene. The idea is to make one of your walls brighter than the other. Usually the wall adjacent or opposite the window is the brightest wall. The &quot;Key&quot; light is usually a spot light positioned at ceiling height, angled slightly, and pointing primarily toward one wall.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">The &quot;Fill&quot; Light</p>
  <p>Sometimes a third light is added to the scene. The &quot;Fill&quot; light is usually positioned to fill in the areas of the scene not covered by the &quot;Key&quot; light.  A directional light can serve well as a &quot;Fill&quot; light. The &quot;Fill&quot; light is usually set to a much lower brightness than the &quot;Key&quot; light.</p>
  <p>The &quot;Fill&quot; light is usually placed at about half room height, pointing sideways. Usually the higher the height of the &quot;Key&quot; light, the lower the height of the &quot;Fill&quot; light.</p>
  <p>Since much of the light in a kitchen is reflected light from walls and floors, try to use the &quot;Fill&quot; light to simulate this effect.  For instance, you might tilt the &quot;Fill&quot; light slightly upward to simulate light being reflected upward from the floor. This can lessen the severity of shadows under upper cabinets. Good use of a &quot;Fill&quot; light can add a subtle glow to cabinet faces and lessen the flatness of the lighting in darker parts of the scene.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Window Light</p>
  <p>A common addition to a kitchen lighting setup is a light shining through a window. A window light is usually a point light set to cast shadows. For direct sunlight, the Beam Softness should be set very sharp, for indirect sunlight set it softer. You may want to set the color of the window light to either sunlight or skylight.</p>
  <p>The &quot;Key&quot; light inside the room is usually turned so that it is the pointing in the same general direction as the window light. The window light is used to cast bright light through the window frame, but the &quot;Key&quot; light is still the primary light source inside the room.</p>
