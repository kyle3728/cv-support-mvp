<h1>Creating A Drawer Front</h1>
<p>As far as Solid is concerned there is no difference between a Door and a Drawer Front. Therefore Drawer Fronts are created the same way Doors are created. Any Door can be used as a Drawer Front, although some Doors will give you an error message saying &quot;Unable to build Drawer Front at Requested Size&quot;. This is because of the way the Door is built. There is not enough room for the Top and Bottom Rails, and the Panel detail you have defined to fit in the Drawer Front height you are trying to build.</p>
