<h1>CAD Dimensioning</h1>
<p>With the ability to edit dimensions through the Layers in Solid, it is less common for the need to arise that dimensions be added manually through CAD. However, the functionality exists to create dimensions in CAD should something need to display dimensions when the automatic dimensions won’t include that item. It is best to use the snap tool with snap turned to &quot;Snap to Points&quot;.</p>
<p>When the snap is set to &quot;Snap to Points&quot;, you will see small node points at every spot on the Object that you may snap to. In order to snap to that point, you must click somewhere close to it but it is not necessary to be exact.</p>
<p>When dimensioning an object in the CAD mode, you may select the type of dimension line that you will use. This is combined with the Dimension Style that is selected (Dimension Styles are set up under the View Group of the main ribbonbar, on the Floor Plan or Elevation Views) to give you the characteristics of the dimension lines that show up on the drawing. The types of dimension lines that are available in CAD are:</p>
<h2>Simple</h2>
<p>The dimension appears exactly where you draw the dimension line. For example, if you pull a dimension from one point to another, the dimension line appears exactly between those two points. The picture below illustrates the dimension between the corner of one cabinet and the corner of another using a Simple Dimension.</p>

<h2>Linear</h2>
<p>The dimension is displayed either horizontally or vertically, not necessarily in line with the points that are being dimensioned. The picture below shows two Linear Dimensions between the same points as in the previous example. Notice that the Linear Dimension does not reflect the angle between the points that are being dimensioned. This dimension shows the distance between the points either vertically or horizontally.</p>

<h2>Aligned</h2>
<p>The dimension line follows the angle between the points being dimensioned. This dimension gives the distance straight between the two points.  See the example below.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/image629.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 210px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Internal</h2>
<p>Use this type of dimension if you are showing interior dimensions. No tick marks will show because the object itself provides the outline for the dimensions. See the example below.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/image630.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 185px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Linear-Tailed</h2>
<p>This option is the same as linear (described above) but with a tail to the points that are being dimensioned. See the example below.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/image631.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 213px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Aligned-Tailed</h2>
<p>This option is the same as aligned (described above) but with a tail to the points that are being dimensioned. See the example below.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/image632.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 209px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Radius</h2>
<p>Use this type of dimension to show the radius of an arc or circle. See the example below.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/image633.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 161px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Diameter</h2>
<p>Use this type of dimension to show the diameter of an arc or circle. See the example below.</p>
<p> <img src="../assets/images/image634.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 156px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p>Use this dimension type to show the angle between two lines (or walls). See example below.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/image635.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 158px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Angular-Tailed</h2>
<p>This dimension type shows angles and includes a tail back to the line that is being dimensioned. See the example below.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/image636.gif" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 194px;" border="0"/></p>
