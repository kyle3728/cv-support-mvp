<h1>Send My Clients Drawings to Review</h1>
<p>If a Client of mine does not have Solid and they want to see their Job, how can I send them pictures of different views?</p>
<h2>Method #1</h2>
<p>Go to the option <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../Room_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/RL_Edit_Group.htm#Copy">Clipboard | Copy</a></span> from whatever view you are in. Then simply open up your favorite word processor or imaging application and click paste and the picture will be pasted on the page. You can then print out and Fax or File...Send via email to your client.</p>
<h2>Method #2 (easiest)</h2>
<p>Another option which is even easier is to purchase a PDF Writer. There are several well known applications that will write PDF files. There are even some free ones on the Internet, such as <a href="http://www.pdf995.com">PDF995</a> or <a href="http://www.pdffactory.com">PDF Factory</a>, or you can get a professional version from <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> called Acrobat, which allows you to print any document to a .pdf file format that can then be sent to your client.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><img src="../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" alt="" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 32px;" border="0"/></span> After one of the above formats (or files) has been created, it needs to be placed in an email as an attachment.</p>
