  <h1>Ribbonbar</h1>
  <h2>Main Tab</h2>
  <p>Following are the options on the Main tab.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image84.png"/></p>
  <p><img height="117" src="assets/images/ribbonbar.png" width="591"/></p>
  <h3>Home Group</h3>
  <p>There is one option in the Home Group:</p>
  <h4><img src="assets/images/image85.png"/> Return</h4>
  <p>When active, this option allows you to go back to the previous screen and/or mode of operation.</p>
  <p>Keystroke</p>
  <p><span><img src="assets/images/image86.png"/></span></p>
  <h3>Zoom Group</h3>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image87.png"/></p>
  <p>The Zoom Group has three options:</p>
  <h4><a id="Zoom_Window" name="Zoom_Window"></a><img src="assets/images/image88.png"/> Window</h4>
  <p>This option is used for increasing the size of an area or Part on your screen to see a detail or examine a condition. By clicking on the Zoom Windows tool, then clicking in the center of the area you would like to Zoom In to, and, while holding the mouse button down, dragging the cursor diagonally across the item you wish to Zoom In on, finally releasing the mouse button at the end of the area, your screen will Zoom In.</p>
  <h4><a id="Zoom_Out" name="Zoom_Out"></a><img src="assets/images/image29.png"/> Out</h4>
  <p>This option incrementally Zooms the view Out.</p>
  <h4><a id="Zoom_All" name="Zoom_All"></a><img src="assets/images/image30.png"/> All</h4>
  <p>This option will restore the object size to the original size and re-center the object in the process.</p>
  <h3>Camera Group</h3>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image89.png"/></p>
  <p>The Camera Group has the following options:</p>
  <h4><a id="Rotate"></a><img src="assets/images/image32.png"/> Rotate</h4>
  <p>To Rotate the view, click and hold the left mouse button in the window. Move the mouse up or down, or left or right. In this mode the Rotation when moving the mouse left to right the object is being rotated about the local Y Axis passing through the Scene.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image38.png"/></p>
  <h4><img src="assets/images/image33.png"/> Move</h4>
  <p>Rotating around the axes to get the view you want may move the view all the way or partially off the screen. The Move View option can be used to center the view on your screen. This option will allow you to maintain the current scene orientation but will move the view to where you want it on the screen. Following the same way to rotate the view, click and drag the view to where you need to view it.</p>
  <h4><img src="assets/images/image90.png"/> Camera Move</h4>
  <p>With this option deselected you can Rotate the model within the Scene without rotating the entire scene. This can be handy when trying to orient a specific part of the HDR Scene outside a specific window.</p>
  <h4>Birdseye</h4>
  <p>This tool will place the current Room or Assembly in a Birdseye point of view.</p>
  <h4><img src="assets/images/image91.png"/> View Management</h4>
  <p>Use this option to move to the Previous View, Next View, or to select a specific View.</p>
  <h4><img src="assets/images/image92.png"/> Play/Pause Walk Through</h4>
  <p>If you saved a Walk Through in your Scene when passed from CABINET VISION you can use this option to &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Pause&quot; the Saved Walk Through.</p>
  <h3>Settings Group</h3>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image93.png"/></p>
  <p>The Settings Group has the following options:</p>
  <h4><img src="assets/images/image54.png"/> Edit Lights</h4>
  <p>This option displays a list of all the Lights in the Scene as specified in CABINET VISION. You can turn on/off any Lights in the list.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image64.png"/></p>
  <h4><img src="assets/images/image55.png"/> Properties</h4>
  <p>Use this option to get the View Properties for this Render. You can also right click in the main viewing area to get to VIew Properties.</p>
  <h4>xRender Tab</h4>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image94.png"/></p>
  <p><strong><span>General - Auto Refresh -</span> </strong>Automatically re-render if Properties have changed.</p>
  <p><strong><span>General - Light Geometry -</span></strong> A global switch to turn on/off light geometry, for light geometry to show, it must be “on” both here and “on” in the light itself.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image95.png"/></p>
  <p><strong><span>Render - Anti Alias -</span></strong> This setting defines the quality of sharp edges.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Render - Light Sampling -</span></strong> Reduces noise in direct light areas. The default value should be sufficient in most cases. Increasing this value will significantly increase Rendering time and may have no real impact on the Render.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Render - Reflection Detail -</span></strong> This setting determines the number of bounces a reflection makes. A lower setting will only reflect off maybe one surface, with a higher value the reflection will bounce onto more surfaces. The default value should be sufficient in most cases. Increasing this value will significantly increase Rendering time and may have no real impact on the Render.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image96.png"/></p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Image Editing -</span></strong> Enables the manipulation of the Post Process Properties defined below in the sidebar after the Render is complete. This gives you a lot of control over the final Render and is highly recommended when high quality renders are desired.</p>
  <p><strong>Post Process - Tone Mapping -</strong> There are four Tonemapping options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clamp - No Tonemapping.</li>
    <li>Photographic - A Tonemapping setting derived from photographers&#39; best practices.</li>
    <li>Neutral - A Neutral Tonemapping setting which does not change any input intensities.</li>
    <li>Exposure - A Tonemapping setting which multiplies the input intensities by the Exposure value.</li>
    <li>Exponential - Exponential tonemapping operator based on the average luminance in an image.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Exposure -</span></strong> The exposure is a multiplicative term applied to the colors of processed image during tone mapping. Increase the exposure to light up your tone mapped image, or decrease it if you want to make it darker.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Gamma -</span></strong> A non-linear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in an image.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Temperature Adjust -</span></strong> Enables/Disables White Balance.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - White Balance -</span></strong> White balance changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for color correction. HSL is an alternative color space to RGB. It is a cylindrical-coordinate representation of color points.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image97.png"/></p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Brightness -</span></strong> This option allows you to increase (Brightness &gt; 0) or decrease (Brightness &lt; 0) the image brightness.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Contrast -</span></strong> This option allows you to increase (Contrast &gt; 0) or decrease (Contrast &lt; 0) the image contrast.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Burn -</span></strong> In a tone-mapped image, pixel luminances have been transformed to the unit interval [0, 1] making feasible to best display it on any device. The pixels having the biggest luminance (Lmax) in the source image are mapped to pixels having luminance = 1 in the tone mapped image. However, sometimes it is desirable to reproduce some kind of burning into the tone-mapped image. It&#39;s a way to reflect how some sensors can saturate (e.g the eye) under too bright light. This is the purpose of the burn factor which expresses how much of the range between [0, Lmax] will burn into the tone-mapped image.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Sharpen -</span></strong> The Sharpen option is used for enhancing the definition of edges in the image. The sharpen filter kernel size is 3x3 pixels.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Glow -</span></strong> The Glow option is used for increasing the white areas intensity in the image. The glow filter kernel size is 11x11 pixels.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Post Process - Blur -</span></strong> The Blur option applies a gaussian blur filter on the final image. The blur filter kernel size varies from 1x1 pixels to 11x11 pixels depending on the slider position.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image98.png"/></p>
  <p><strong><span>Background - Style -</span></strong> Select the Background Style from the following options:</p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li><span>Plain-</span> Renders the background color behind your scene.</li>
    <li><span>Graduated-</span> Renders a gradient running vertically from background to foreground color.</li>
    <li><span>Image-</span> Allows you to use a Bitmap image as the background.<span></span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><span>Background - Back -</span></strong> Select the Background color here.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Background - Fore -</span></strong> Select the Foreground color here.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Background - Image -</span></strong>Select the Background Image, if the Style is set to Image, here.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image99.png"/></p>
  <p><strong><span>Image - Size -</span></strong> This option sets what pixel resolution the images will be rendered out at when you use the Photovision to File options. You can use the pre-set image sizes, or set your own by using Custom.  The higher the resolution, the longer it will take to render the image.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Image - Width -</span></strong> If Custom is selected for Image Size then set the Custom Image Width here.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Image - Height -</span></strong> If Custom is selected for Image Size then set the Custom Image Height here.</p>
  <h4>Realtime Tab</h4>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image100.png"/></p>
  <p><strong>Headlight - Brightness -</strong> Use this option to control the Brightness of the Head Light. The farther right the slider the &quot;Brighter&quot; the Head Light will be. The Head Light is a Light which always shines from your Viewing perspective (all other Lights move with the view&#39;s rotation.). Basically, imagine this as a Light shining from your computer screen onto the scene as this is what it simulates.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image101.png"/></p>
  <p><strong>Render - Anti Alias -</strong> This setting defines the quality of sharp edges.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image102.png"/></p>
  <p><strong>Post Process -</strong> Covered above.</p>
  <h4>+Tour Tab</h4>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image103.png"/></p>
  <p><strong>Settings - Geometry Scale -</strong> The scale of the objects in the Tour.<strong></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Settings - FOV (Field of View) -</strong> The angle of the Field of View.</p>
  <p><strong>Settings - Walk Speed -</strong> The speed used to move from one Camera View to another when Playing the Tour.</p>
  <p><strong>Settings - Rotate Speed -</strong> The speed of Rotation when using the mouse in Rotate mode.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image104.png"/></p>
  <p><strong>Render - Anti Alias -</strong> The smoothness of the edges of the rendered scene. The larger the value the higher the quality but the slower the generation.</p>
  <p><strong>Render - GI Cache Scale -</strong> The quality of the GI Cache. The larger the value the higher the quality but the slower the generation.</p>
  <p><strong>Render - Generate Reflection -</strong> Enables/Disables Reflections.</p>
  <p><strong>Render - Ambient -</strong> The brightness of the Ambient Light.</p>
  <p><strong>Render - Shadow Quality -</strong> The quality of the Shadows. The larger the value the higher the quality but the slower the generation.</p>

  <p><img src="assets/images/image105.png"/></p>
  <p><strong>Post Process -</strong> Covered above.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/image107.png"/></p>
  <p><strong>Background - Style -</strong> Here you can choose to have no background or browse and utilize any 3D HDR files you have as a background. There are a lot of sources for 3D HDR files on the Internet.</p>
