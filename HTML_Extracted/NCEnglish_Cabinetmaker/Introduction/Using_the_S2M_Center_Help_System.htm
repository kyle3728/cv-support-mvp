  <h1>About Cabinetmaker S2M CENTER Help</h1>
  <p>Thank you for choosing Cabinetmaker by CABINET VISION. These help files were created in order to make your experience with this product more enjoyable and productive. We welcome your feedback so please let us know if you find this information useful by emailing us at tech@cabinetvision.com.</p>
  <p>The format of these Help files should closely follow the layout of the S2M CENTER itself. Also, you may press the F1 key on your keyboard to see help on the current window.</p>
  <p>In order to get the most from using the S2M CENTER help files, it is important to first know some terms of communication that will be used throughout the Help System.</p>
  <p>First, any time that you are to navigate through menus to perform a certain function, the menu sequence will appear as follows:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">Main | Help | Help Topics</p>
  <p>This tells you that you should click on the <span style="font-weight: bold; 
													 color: #0000ff;">Main</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff;">tab</span>, then click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Help</span>, and finally, click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Help Topics</span> in order to get to the specified location.</p>
  <p><img src="../assets/images/image1.png"/></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Secondly, it is important to understand the terminology used in describing movements and clicks of the mouse.</p>
  <p>On a mouse with the typical configuration, the left button is used as a Select tool.  The right button is used as an alternate select tool.  Some mice have a third button or a wheel.</p>
  <p>With this typical configuration, if you see the word <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;click&quot;</span> used in these help files, that means to click one time with the left mouse button on the object specified.  A <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;double-click&quot;</span> means to click two times in relatively rapid succession on the item or object specified.  A <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;right-click&quot;</span> means to click one time with the right mouse button on the object specified.  Also, you will be asked to <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;drag&quot;</span> objects with the mouse at certain times.  This means that you will hold the mouse over the specified object, click and hold the left mouse button, then move the mouse while still holding the left button until you reach the area that you were instructed to move the object to.  Some objects may be <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;dropped&quot;</span> by simply letting go of the left mouse button.  Other objects must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;dropped&quot;</span> by clicking again when you reach the destination.  This will be something that you will simply have to practice in order to master.</p>
  <p>Third, when describing buttons on the keyboard, they will appear as images like this:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" height="40" src="../assets/images/Graphics/Keyboard/enter_key.png" style="border: none;" width="99"/></p>
  <p>If there is a sequence of buttons that need to be pressed, it will appear as follows:</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="" border="0" height="40" src="../assets/images/Graphics/Keyboard/ctrl_key.png" style="border: none;" width="67"/> + <img alt="" border="0" height="40" src="../assets/images/Graphics/Keyboard/alt_key.png" style="border: none;" width="59"/> + <img alt="" border="0" height="40" src="../assets/images/Graphics/Keyboard/delete.png" style="border: none;" width="44"/></p>
  <p>The above keys must all be pressed in the sequence displayed and each remain depressed until the last key press is performed to get the desired result.</p>
  <p>Next, the help files will sometimes refer to <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;pull down&quot;</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;drop down&quot;</span> menus.  Those are both the same type of menu and will be evidenced by an arrow to the right of the selections that you will click on to expand the choices.  Here is an example:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/image784.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>When you click on the arrow to expand the menu, you will see this:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/image785.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>You will also see links to other topics in the help files. A link will appear like this:  <a href="using_the_s2m_center_help_system.htm#ContextSensitiveHelp">click here</a>.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;"><a name="ContextSensitiveHelp" id="ContextSensitiveHelp"></a>Context Sensitive Help</p>
  <p>As you navigate through the S2M Center, you can press <img alt="" border="0" height="40" src="../assets/images/Graphics/Keyboard/f1_key.png" style="border: none;" width="42"/> for tips.</p>
