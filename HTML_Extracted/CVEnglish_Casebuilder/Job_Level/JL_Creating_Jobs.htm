  <h1>Overview of Building a Job</h1>
  <p>Your first Job with Casebuilder will be a rewarding experience. The amount of time it takes will quickly decrease as you become more familiar with Casebuilder and how to navigate between the various screens and menus used to create your Job. When working
    with a computer remember the GIGO acronym, which stands for &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;.  A better way of saying the same thing is this, &quot;Your end results will reflect the care and attention you paid to the details while working in Casebuilder&quot;.</p>
  <p>This topic covers how to define a Job as to Material and the Construction Methods necessary to meet the Job&#39;s requirements.</p>
  <p>The concept of Local Changes and Global Changes as well as Importing and Exporting changes are concepts that shed additional light on when and why changes may or may not occur.</p>
  <p>Prior to starting your Job, it would be beneficial to familiarize yourself with the tools and features available for use in creating the Job.</p>
  <h2>Step 1:  Plan the Job</h2>
  <p>Who is the customer?</p>
  <p>What kind of Job is it?  a kitchen?  a laundry area?  an entertainment center? furniture? closet?</p>
  <p>What are the dimensions of the Room(s)?</p>
  <p>What types of <a href="../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Material_Manager/SL_Material_Manager.htm">Materials</a> will be used? Does the customer want to see several different options?</p>
  <p>What type of <a href="../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Construction_Group/Assembly_Manager/SL_Assembly_Manager.htm">Construction Method</a> will be used?</p>
  <p>What <a href="../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Door_Manager/SL_Door_Catalog.htm">Door Styles</a> will be used?  Does the customer want to see several options?</p>
  <p>What kind of Hardware will be used? <a href="../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Material_Schedules/MS_Pulls.htm">Door/Drawer Pulls</a>? <a href="../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Material_Schedules/MS_Hinges.htm">Hinges</a>?
    <a href="../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Material_Schedules/MS_Drawer_Guides.htm">Drawer Guides</a>? Wire Baskets?</p>
  <p>It may be helpful to design a specification sheet that gets filled out when the customer requests a quote. This form should contain the information listed above as well as any additional information that will be helpful in setting up the Job. </p>
  <h2><a name="JobProperties" id="JobProperties"></a>Step 2:  Start the Job in Casebuilder</h2>
  <p>From the opening screen, click on <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"><a href="../Introduction/The_CV_Button/SL_Solid_Button.htm#New">File Menu | New</a></span></p>
  <p>The Job Properties window is the first thing that you will see when you begin a new Job.</p>
  <p style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><img src="../assets/images/image1241.png"/></p>
  <h2>Step 3:  Layout the Job in Casebuilder</h2>
  <p>When you have finished entering the Job Properties, you will then click OK to move on to the Order Entry of the Job.</p>
  <h2>Step 4:  Placing Objects</h2>
  <p>Next, you will want to go into Order Entry mode then drag and drop your Cabinets from the Catalog. You can &quot;drag&quot; that Cabinet out of the Catalog by clicking on it and holding the left mouse button down as you pull the Cabinet out of the Catalog.
    When you get the Cabinet out of the Catalog and over the Order Entry area you can release the mouse button and you will see the line item added.</p>
  <h2>Step 5:  Assembly Sheets</h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Click the Assembly Sheets button to generate Assembly Sheets for your Cabinets.</span></p>
  <h2>Step 6:  Send to ALPHACAM</h2>
  <p>Click the Send to ALPHACAM button to send all the Cabinet Parts to ALPHACAM.</p>
