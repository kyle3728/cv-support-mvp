  <p>Allows the selection of the <a href="../../../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Door_Manager/SL_Door_Catalog.htm">Door Style</a> for Doors, Drawer Fronts, and End Panels (Panelized Ends and Applied Doors) for the active Cabinet/Closet,
    based on it&#39;s Class (Upper/Base/Closet).</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">The Door selection interface is designed to allow you to have complete control over the Door Styles for your Cabinet with the fewest selections possible. The most important area in this configuration screen is the All branch. With this you can specify
    the General Door Style, Material, and Profile the majority of your Doors will be.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image494.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">For instance, let&#39;s say I wanted to have a Cathedral Arch Door for my Upper Cabinets I would simply expand the Upper Branch and select that Door Style and would need to make no other changes. If you will notice in the image below I have selected
    the Cathedral Arch Raised Panel Door Style for my Upper Cabinets. Also notice that instead of normal text the text is italicized, this is way for you to quickly see that you have selected something that differs from the &quot;All&quot; selection.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image496.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Another example would be my Drawer Fronts. I would not do a Square Raised Panel for those but a Solid Wood Drawer Front instead.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image497.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">You are also not limited to Style differences from the &quot;All&quot; selection as you can see in the Drawer Front example above my Inside Edge Detail and Raised Panel Detail also differ from the &quot;All&quot; selection. I could also choose an alternate
    Material for my Drawer Fronts as well.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Warning.png" style="border: none;"/> By selecting a Door Style for Base EP (End Panel), Upper EP, and Tall EP you are not necessarily, depending on <a href="../../../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Construction_Group/Assembly_Manager/Assembly/Branches/Exterior_Case/AW_Finished_End.htm">Finished End</a>    type in the <a href="../../../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Construction_Group/Assembly_Manager/SL_Assembly_Manager.htm">Construction Method</a>, changing or modifying your Cabinets Ends, instead, you are selecting the style of Door that will
    be used <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">only if</span> you do select to have these ends on the Cabinet.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
  <h2>Texturize Preview</h2>
  <p>This option will display the selected Materials Texture on it&#39;s corresponding Door Style Image in the Preview Pane.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Warning.png" style="border: none;"/> Remember changes made here will only affect the current Assembly. Also, changes made here are attached as permanent (unless you remove them)
    overrides on the Assembly; which means that if you Save this Assembly into a Catalog these overrides will also be Saved.</p>
