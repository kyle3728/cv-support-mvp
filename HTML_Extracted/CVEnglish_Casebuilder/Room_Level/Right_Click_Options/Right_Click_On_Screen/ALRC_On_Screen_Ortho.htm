  <p>Following are the options when right clicking the screen in a Face, Plan, or End Ortho view:</p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="Save"></a>Save</span></h2>
  <p>The reference to an Object in Casebuilder includes Cabinets, and other items that you save to your library. Appliances, Cabinets, Closet Objects, Furniture, etc., are all objects. After creating a special Assembly or other object decide whether this
    will be a desirable item to have available in future Jobs. If this is a one time only creation, it is not necessary to save it as it will be saved when the Job is saved. However, it will only be available in the Job it is saved with. If it is possible
    that the item will be required for other Jobs it must be saved back into your library.</p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>Save versus Save As</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><img src="../../../assets/images/image1405.png"/></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">Right clicking on the screen at the Assembly Level, will provide a menu option similar to the one shown above. Note that there are two options under the &quot;save&quot; feature. It is important to understand the difference between the two options. In the simplest terms, Save keeps the new item in its new form at the expense of loosing the prior item (the pre-edit form). Save As allows for the creation of a new item. In effect, Save As allows for two items when finished, whereas, Save allows for only one. Save overwrites the original item, whereas Save As creates a new item in addition to the original one. Use the Save feature when you want a permanent change to an existing item or Assembly, and the Save As feature when you want the new item in addition to the existing one. Save As will allow you to rename the new item and place it in other libraries you may have made.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><strong>Features Common to Save and Save As</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><img src="../../../assets/images/image1406.png"/></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">The first option allows choosing of a Library by clicking on the Library Symbols in the left window as shown on the above screen capture. Thereafter, if desired, the icon can be changed by typing the selected name in the &quot;Name&quot; box at the top. The Description can be changed to represent your Assembly. An Icon should be chosen from the list at the right that represents the Assembly you are saving. This is done by clicking on the one of your choice.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><a id="Preserve_Finish" name="Preserve_Finish"></a><strong>Preserve Finish</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">This feature will save the item you are saving to your Library with any Finish overrides you have applied to the Object or its Parts.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><a id="PreserveHeight" name="PreserveHeight"></a><strong>Preserve Height</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">This feature will save the item you are saving to your library at the Height you have edited it to, instead of the default Assembly Height. If you have created an object that is of a different Height than a default Assembly, it is advisable to select this option. You will still be able to stretch or re-size it&#39;s Height after you bring it into a new Job regardless of whether you select this option or not.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><a id="PreserveDepth" name="PreserveDepth"></a><strong>Preserve Depth</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">This feature will save the item you are saving to your library at the Depth you have edited it to, instead of the default Assembly Depth. If you have created an object that is of a different Depth than a default Assembly, it is advisable to select this option. You will still be able to stretch or re-size it&#39;s Depth after you bring it into a new Job regardless of whether you select this option or not.</span></p>
  <h3>The Advanced Button</h3>
  <p><a id="The_Class_Tab" name="The_Class_Tab"></a><strong><span style="margin-left:40px;">The Class Tab</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">The Class tab allows selection of the Class and Type of the object to be saved.</span></p>
  <p><img src="../../../assets/images/image1407.png"/></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">It is a good idea to keep Base Class objects, Wall Class objects, etc within their original class as other areas of Casebuilder identify objects by their Class.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style="margin-left:40px;"><a id="The_Placement_Tab" name="The_Placement_Tab"></a>The Placement Tab</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">There is one area on the Placement Tab:</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><img src="../../../assets/images/image1408.png"/></span></p>
  <p><strong><span style="margin-left:40px;">Stretching</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">By enabling or disabling the Width, Height, and/or Depth options you can control whether the Object can be re-sized in those dimensions.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span style="margin-left:40px;"><a id="The_Preserves_Tab" name="The_Preserves_Tab"></a>The Preserves Tab</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">Clicking the Advanced button will present menus that allow preservation of other attributes, such as Material or Construction Methods.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;"><img src="../../../assets/images/image1409.png"/></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:40px;">Using this feature will effectively lock your Cabinet from further changes in other Jobs, therefore, it should be used sparingly.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Properties</span></p>
  <p>Following are the options in Properties.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../assets/images/image1410.png"/></p>
  <p><strong><span><a id="Grid_Spacing"></a>Grid Spacing -</span></strong> Controls the size of the grid squares on the screen when using the Grid Snap option from the statusbar menu.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Grid Always Visible -</span></strong> Normally the Grid is only displayed when Grid Snapping is on. Simply enable this option to have the Grid Always display.</p>
  <p><strong><span>Reset Ruler</span> -</strong> This removes any snap marks (red Xs) on the view.</p>
