  <h1>Assembly Sheet</h1>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../../assets/images/image1377.png"/></p>
  <p>Assembly sheets are special Reports designed for your assemblers. They will typically have a picture of a single Assembly in the upper right corner of the printout, with all the Parts that go to that Assembly down the left side of the printout, and
    all the specifications for that Assembly along the bottom of the printout. See the Assembly Sheet Layout section later in this topic for more information.</p>
