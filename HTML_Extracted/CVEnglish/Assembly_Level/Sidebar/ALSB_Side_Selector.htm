  <h1>Side Selector Section View <img alt="" border="0" height="21" src="../../assets/images/image180.gif" style="border: none;" width="60"/> - <img src="../../assets/images/image3034.png"/> Section Face</h1>
  <p>This Side Selector interface allows you to select the Side of the Assembly you would like to modify in the Section Editor. In the image below the Assembly was edited in an Ortho View so that the Top and Front of the Assembly were setup to have Faces. When Faces are defined on two different planes it activates the plane selection drop down at the Top. In the View below we have the End View selected so we can define the Top (Priority 1), the Front (Priority 2), the Back, and the Bottom of the Assembly.</p>

  <h2>Face Priority Explanation</h2>
  <p>The face priority is the order in which the interior of the Assembly will be sectioned. It is done in the order 1, 2, 3, etc. If you put in a Partition on Face priority 1 it will cut all the way through the Assembly. If you then put a Partition on Face priority 2, the Partition will stop where it meets Partition 1. If you change the priorities around so 2 becomes 1, then the old 2 will now go all the way through the Assembly and the old 1 will stop where it meets the other Partition.</p>

  <h2>Side Selector with a Standard Assembly</h2>
  <p>When you first enter the Section Editor with a Standard (Non-Shaped) Assembly you will be presented with the following sidebar view.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image2861.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>You can select any of the four Sides presented in the Side Selector. By selecting either of the Ends represented by the Side selector you will receive the following options:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image2862.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Side Types -</span> Here you can select whether the selected Side in the Side Selector is defined as a Face or an End. If you select Face you can then Section it just like a standard Assemblies Face.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">End -</span> If End is selected in Side Types, as is the case in the image above, you can define the Ends Type. There are eleven options here:</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">

          <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Automatic</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> When Automatic is selected as the End Type you give Solid control to determine what the End type is based on it’s condition. Basically this means it follows the logic of Unfinished End when against a Wall or other Assembly or Finished end when the End is exposed.</p>
