  <h1>Overview of Editing Assemblies</h1>
  <p>An understanding of the <a href="../../Introduction/Getting_Started/how_it_all_comes_together.htm">Hierarchy of CABINET VISION</a> is necessary before you will fully appreciate the editing potential of CABINET VISION. Assembly Editing requires an understanding
    of the various areas that editing is possible, as well as which areas allow for Assemblies or Parts to retain their logic (I.E., stretch, etc). Editing is the process of sectioning an Assembly or object so that it acquires the look and status of the
    new Assembly. Typically, this is accomplished by two methods of editing. Section editing is the process where an Assembly is divided into vertical or horizontal areas that are assigned properties, such as Door, Drawer, or Roll Out. Orthographic editing
    is the process of adding or replacing Parts, and thereafter re-establishing intelligence, or allowing an Override on that Part to exist. These two methods also represent the  two main editing views:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Section Editing -</span> This allows for intelligent editing of the Face and interior (Case) of an Assembly. This also includes menu options for rapidly changing Assembly Properties and attributes. Section Editing is
    the favored method of Assembly editing. It allows for modifications to the Assembly Face as well as the Assembly interior (Case). All editing performed in the Section Editing views retains intelligence with the Assembly. The retention of intelligence
    allows the edited Part or area to respond to changes in an Assemblies dimensions. Access to the &quot;Section Face&quot; view is gained via the Section <img alt="" border="0" height="21" src="../../assets/images/image180.gif" style="border: none;" width="60"/> tab, and the Section Face <img src="../../assets/images/image1144.png"/> option.</p>
  <p><img src="../../assets/images/image1143.png"/></p>
  <p>The Section Interior option is typical to the above graphic, with the exception that the Section Interior <img src="../../assets/images/image1145.png"/> option is selected while in the section window, the Section <img alt="" border="0" height="21" src="../../assets/images/image180.gif" style="border: none;" width="60"/> tab must be clicked before either the &quot;Section Face&quot; or &quot;Section Interior&quot; Section tools appear.</p>
  <p>Section Editing is a feature of the Assembly Level of CABINET VISION. Therefore the changes you are making to the Assembly in this level are limited to that Assembly, and will not appear on other Assemblies within that Room. If you desire the changes
    to be available for additional Assemblies, consider saving the Assembly to your library.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;">Access Via the &quot;Section&quot; View Menu Option</p>
  <p>Another method that allows section editing of an Assembly and has as an additional feature; the Elevation from which the Assembly exists at shown, is the &quot;Section&quot; option available at the &quot;Layout&quot; level.  Access this option by right
    clicking on an Assembly in the Elevation View of the Layout Level, and select the menu option &quot;Section&quot;. You will then be able to Section Edit the Assembly live in the Elevation View without having to go to the Assembly Level.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../Assembly_Level_Ortho_Views/Overview_of_Orthographic_Editing.htm">Orthographic Editing</a> - </span>This editing is the more powerful of the two, at the expense of possible logic being lost. Overrides on Part
    logic can occur here too. See the section on Orthographic Editing, and the section on overrides for more information.</p>
