<h1>Third Exercise</h1>
<p>So lets add another part to the cabinet and make it even more interesting.  This time we will add a BOARD but it will be going left and right placed to fit between the BOARD@2 we have already placed and the right side of the cabinet.  It will be centered in the cabinet opening up and down between BOARD@1 and the deck.  See following picture.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/image78.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" width="336" height="318" border="0"/></p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on the &quot;Face&quot; <img src="../../../../assets/images/image181.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" width="45" height="21" border="0"/> ortho view tab, and then click on the &quot;New Part&quot; button.  When the &quot;New Part&quot; screen comes up, under the &quot;Part Type&quot; area select &quot;Board&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on &quot;Next&quot;. This will bring you to the &quot;Size&quot; tab.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">If you where to measure the distance from the right side of BOARD@2 and the side of the cabinet it would be 15 1/4.  So set the length to 15 1/4&quot;, set the &quot;Width&quot; to 4&quot;.  Leave the thickness alone.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">On the &quot;Orientation&quot; tab select &quot;Front&quot; orientation.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">You should now be at the &quot;Finish&quot; tab.  For this demonstration the finish doesn&#39;t matter.  Click on the &quot;Finish&quot; button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing we are going to do is to manually rotate this part so it is going in the correct direction.  We want to it to tip to the right with the length going left and right.  Then we will manually place it where it needs to go in the cabinet.  We will then begin to write formulas for it.  If you are not at a front ortho view, click on it now.  To rotate the part so that it is laying on its right side.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on the part to highlight it.  On the left side of your screen where it says, &quot;Rotate part by…&quot; we will need to enter a negative (-) 90 degrees.  The part will be hinging on the Z-axis to rotate down to the right.  We are already <span style="font-weight: bold;">facing the reference point</span>, so to rotate the part clockwise it needs to be a negative amount. See &quot;<a href="../The_Basics/Positive_(+)_and_Negative_(-).htm">Positive (+) and Negative (-) Rotation</a> &quot;. Enter –90 and press enter.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">We now need to place the part &quot;Left/Right&quot; if your cabinet is still 36&quot; wide, and you have done everything you were supposed to up till now, the &quot;Left/Right&quot; would be 20&quot;.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Half the width of the cabinet (18&quot;) plus half the width of BOARD#2 (2&quot;). 18 + 2 = 20.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">We now need to place the part &quot;Up/Down&quot; if your cabinet is still 34 1/2&quot; and you have done everything you were supposed to up till now the &quot;Up/Down&quot; will be 19 3/8&quot;.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The up and down (Y) of BOARD#2 plus half the length (DY) of BOARD#2 plus half the width (DX) of BOARD#3.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">It now needs to move to the front of the cabinet (24 - .75 = 23.25), so we enter 23 1/4&quot; were it says &quot;In/Out&quot; and press enter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The part is now rotated and positioned correctly and we are ready to give the part intelligence.</p>
