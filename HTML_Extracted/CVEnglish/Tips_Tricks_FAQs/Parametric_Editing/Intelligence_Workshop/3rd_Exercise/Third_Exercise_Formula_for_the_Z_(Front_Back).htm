  <h1>Third Exercise Formula for the Z (Front/Back)</h1>
  <p>Look at your cabinet from a side ortho view and click on BOARD@3.  Notice where the reference point is located.  Click on some of the other parts in the cabinet (especially the first and second board).  Notice where the reference point is located.</p>
  <p>There are several formulas that will work.  We could say the Z of Board@3 is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Z of the deck minus the thickness of board@3</span>.  We could say it is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the depth of the cabinet minus the thickness of board@3</span>.  We could say it is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Z position of the front stretcher plus the width of the front stretcher minus the thickness of board@3</span>.  We could say the Z of board@3 is equal to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Z of board@1 (or board@2)</span>.  I think well use this last one; the Z of board@3 is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Z of board@1</span>.  When we trace the Z of board@1 through the tree it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board@1.Z</span> or just <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board.Z</span> we don’t have to put in the &quot;@&quot; symbol for the first part in a list of similarly named parts.</p>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Go to the object tree and click on the first BOARD.  Then click on the Z parameter.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">When we trace the Z of board@1 through the tree it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board@1.Z</span> or just <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board.Z</span> we don’t have to put in the &quot;@&quot; symbol for the first part in a list if we don’t want to.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on BOARD@3.  Then click on the Z parameter.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on &quot;Edit&quot; and change from a &quot;Value&quot; to an &quot;Equation&quot;.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">On the THEN line type the code you traced through the tree.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click the &quot;Test&quot; button and it should say &quot;Condition returned: True.  Equation returned: 23 1/4 or whatever value you were expecting.  Click on OK.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Always go back and look at your cabinet in 3D (at the Assembly Level) and see if it still looks OK.</p>
