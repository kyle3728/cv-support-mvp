  <h1>Formula for the DY (Length)</h1>
  <p>Look at your cabinet in 3D.  Look at it from a Face <img alt="" border="0" height="21" src="../../../../assets/images/image181.gif" style="border: none;" width="45"/> ortho view and click on the BOARD.  Notice where the reference point is located.  Click on several of the other parts and notice where their reference points are located.</p>
  <p>There are several formulas that will work.  We could say the DY of board@2 is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the height of the cabinet (DY) minus the width (DX) of the front toe minus the thickness (DZ) of the deck minus the thickness (DZ) of the top stretcher minus the width (DX) of board@1.</span>  Or we could say the DY of board@2 was equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the height (DY) of the &quot;Case&quot; minus the thickness (DZ) of the deck minus the thickness (DZ) of the top stretcher minus the width (DX) of board@1.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> If you go into your Object Tree and open it until you see the &quot;Case&quot; and if you click on the &quot;Case&quot; you will see that the DY of the case is the DY of the cabinet minus the toe kick height (DX of the front toe, as the toe is laying on its side so the width (DX) is up and down).  So using the DY of the &quot;Case&quot; could save us a little on our formula.</p>
  <p>Or we could say the DY of board@2 is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Y of board@1 minus the width of board@1 minus the Y of the deck.</span>  There are more but we’ll use this one.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 160px;">Y (up and down) of board@1 = 33.75&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 160px;">Width (DX) of Board@1 = 4&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 160px;">Y (up and down) of Deck = 5&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 160px;">33.75&quot; – 4&quot; = 29.75&quot;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 160px;">29.75&quot; – 5&quot; = 24.75&quot; the length of board@2</p>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Open up your Object Tree until you can see the deck.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on the deck and then click on the Y trace it through the tree.  Write it down. Answer Cab.Case.De.Y.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on BOARD@1 and then click on the Y.  Trace it through the tree.  Write it down.  Answer Cab.Board@1.Y.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">You should be on BOARD@1.  Click on the width of BOARD@1 Trace it through the tree and write it down.  Answer Cab.Board@1.Dx.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Combine the code together <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Y of board#1 minus the width of board#1 minus the Y of the deck.</span> Answer Cab.Board@1.Y - Cab.Board@1.dx - Cab.Case.De.Y.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on BOARD@2 then click on the DY.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on &quot;Edit&quot; and then change from a &quot;Value&quot; to an &quot;Equation&quot;.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Write your code on the THEN line.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click the &quot;Test&quot; button and it should say &quot;Condition returned: True.  Equation returned: 24 3/4 or whatever value you were expecting.  Click on OK.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Look at your cabinet in 3D does it look OK?</p>
  <p>Try changing the size of the cabinet the width, the height and the depth.  The BOARD we added should move and size correctly.  You might want to save the cabinet back into your library so you can do the third example exercise later.  Don’t forget to size the cabinet back to its original size.</p>
