<h1>Formula for the X (Left/Right)</h1>
<p>Look at your cabinet in 3D.  Look at it from a front ortho view and click on the second BOARD.  Notice where the reference point is located.  Look at it from a top view and from a side view, click on the BOARD.  Notice where the reference point is located.  When writing code for the position of a part it is important to know where the reference point is.</p>
<p>We will need a formula for the X because the BOARD is centered in the cabinet.  If the width of the cabinet were ever to change the BOARD would need to move so that it stayed centered.  Also what if the width of the board were to change? This would also throw off the centering.</p>
<p>See if you can come up with the formula for centering the BOARD yourself.  Hint; you already know what the formula is because you centered the board in the cabinet to start off with.</p>
<p>Before we continue you will need to know a little about <a href="../The_Basics/Operands_and_the_Order_of_Operations.htm">&quot;operands&quot; and the &quot;order&quot; of mathematical operations</a>.</p>
