  <h1>Formula for the Z (Front/Back)</h1>
  <p>Look at your cabinet from an End <img alt="" border="0" height="21" src="../../../../assets/images/image183.gif" style="border: none;" width="42"/> ortho view and click on the second BOARD.  Notice where the reference point is located.  Click on some of the other parts in the cabinet (especially the first board).  Notice where the reference point is located.</p>
  <p>There are several formulas that will work.  We could say the Z of Board@2 is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Z of the deck minus the thickness of board@2.</span>  Click on the Deck and notice where the Z is.  We could say it is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the depth of the cabinet minus the thickness of board@2.</span>  We could say it is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Z position of the front stretcher plus the width of the front stretcher minus the thickness of board@2.</span>  We could say <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Z of board@2</span> is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Z of board@1</span>.  I think well use this last one; the Z of board@2 is equal to the Z of board@1.  When we trace the Z of board@1 through the tree it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board@1.Z</span> or just <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board.Z</span> we don’t have to put in the &quot;@&quot; symbol for the first part in a list of similarly named parts.</p>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Go to the Object Tree and click on the first BOARD.  Then click on the Z parameter. When we trace the Z of board@1 through the tree it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board@1.Z</span> or just <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cab.Board.Z</span> we don’t have to put in the &quot;@&quot; symbol for the first part in a list if we don’t want to.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on the second BOARD.  Then click on the Z parameter.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on &quot;Edit&quot; and change from a &quot;Value&quot; to an &quot;Equation&quot;.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">On the THEN line type the code you traced through the tree.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click the &quot;Test&quot; button and it should say &quot;Condition returned: True.  Equation returned: 23 1/4 or whatever value you were expecting.  Click on OK.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Look at your cabinet in 3D does it look OK?</p>
