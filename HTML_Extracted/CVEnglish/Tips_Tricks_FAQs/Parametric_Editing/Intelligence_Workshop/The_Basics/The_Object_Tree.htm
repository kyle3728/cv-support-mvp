  <h1>The Object Tree</h1>
  <p>The Object Tree gives you access to the parameters of the objects making up your Job/Room/Assembly/Part. It is called the Object Tree because it branches like a tree.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Object Tree (Room level)</p>
  <p>The following picture shows a typical Object Tree from the Room Level. To access the Object Tree from the Room Level click the Object Tree tab <img height="22" src="../../../../assets/images/Room_Level/Side_Bar/SidebarObjectTreeTab.png" usemap="#imagemap" width="23" style="border: none;"/> at the bottom of the sidebar.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image1122.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;"/></p>
  <p>The Object Tree represents the hierarchy (or chain of command) of a Job or an Assembly. Each item of a Job occupies a particular place on the &quot;Object Tree&quot; and its branching structure. If you were to view the Object Tree at the Assembly Level then the same tree structure applies, but only to the one Assembly.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Object Tree (Assembly level)</p>
  <p>To see the Object Tree for a single object, say a Cabinet. Right click on the Cabinet and select &quot;Edit&quot;. Then click the Object Tree tab <img height="22" src="../../../../assets/images/Room_Level/Side_Bar/SidebarObjectTreeTab.png" usemap="#imagemap" width="23" style="border: none;"/> at the bottom of the sidebar.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image1124.png"/></p>
  <p>Notice the nine basic parameters in the lower pane of the above screen. I know it has a couple extra parameters, don&#39;t worry about them for now. These parameters are for the &quot;Finished Left End&quot; (or LF) since it is the object highlighted.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The X (Left/Right)</span> = 3/4&quot; so the reference point of the end is 3/4&quot; from the reference point of the Cabinet (3/4&quot; from the left end).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Y (Up/Down)</span> = 4&quot; so the reference point of the end is 4&quot; up from the reference point of the Cabinet (4&quot; up from the bottom).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Z (Front/Back)</span> = 0&quot; so the reference pint of the end is lined up with the reference point of the Cabinet (0&quot; from the back).</p>
  <p>The reference point for the Cabinet is in its left, bottom, and back corner, and the reference point for the Part is in its right, bottom, and back corner.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The DX = 24</span> so the width of this end is 24&quot;.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The DY = 30 1/2</span> so the length of this end is 30 1/2&quot;.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The DZ = 3/4</span> so the thickness of this end is 3/4&quot;.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The AX = 0</span> so this Part has not been rotated on the X-axis.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The AY = -90</span> so this Part has been rotated on the Y-axis (clockwise) to face left.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The AZ = 0</span> so this Part has not been rotated on the Z-axis.</p>
