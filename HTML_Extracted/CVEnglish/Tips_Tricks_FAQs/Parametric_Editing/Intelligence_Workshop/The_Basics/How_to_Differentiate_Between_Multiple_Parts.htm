<h1>How to Differentiate Between Multiple Parts</h1>
<p>When there is more than one part with the same name you use the &quot;@&quot; (at) symbol to differentiate between them.  Example say there where five boards, the first one would be BOARD or BOARD@1, the second one would be BOARD@2 the third one would be BOARD@3, the fourth one would be BOARD@4, Etc.</p>
<p>For the first part in the list you don’t have to use the &quot;@&quot; (at) symbol.  If you just type BOARD, the program goes to the first BOARD on the list, or if you type BOARD@1 it goes to the first BOARD on the list.  It’s all the same to the program, but for the other parts you must use the &quot;@&quot; symbol and what number the part is in the list.</p>
