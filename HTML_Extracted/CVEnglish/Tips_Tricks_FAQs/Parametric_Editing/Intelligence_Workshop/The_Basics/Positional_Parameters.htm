<h1>Positional Parameters</h1>
<p>The &quot;Positional&quot; parameters are: X, Y, and Z, these parameters are used to record the position of an object, in relation to its parent object, such as an Assembly on a Wall, or a Part in an Assembly. The Wall would be the parent for the Assembly, and the Assembly would be the parent for the Part.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">X = Left and Right</p>
<p>The left and right position of an object, also called its X position.  A positive adjustment will move the object to the right of its parents &quot;Reference Point&quot;, while a negative adjustment will move the object to the left of its parents &quot;Reference Point&quot;.  For example if the X position of a Cabinet were 23&quot; (X = 23), we would know that the Cabinet was 23&quot; from the left end of the Wall (toward the right end of the Wall). See the diagram below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Y = Up and Down</p>
<p>The up and down position of an object, also called its Y position.  A positive adjustment will move the object up from its parents reference point, while a negative adjustment will move the object down from it parents reference point. For example if the Y position of a Cabinet were 23&quot; (Y = 23) we would know that the Cabinet was raised 23&quot; off the floor. See the diagram below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Z = Front to Back (or In and Out)</p>
<p>The front to back position of an object, also called its Z position.  A positive adjustment will move the object forward from its parents reference point, while a negative adjustment will move the object backward from its parents reference point.  For example if the Z position of a Cabinet was 23&quot; (Z = 23) we would know that the Cabinet was 23&quot; away from the face of the Wall. See the diagram below.</p>
