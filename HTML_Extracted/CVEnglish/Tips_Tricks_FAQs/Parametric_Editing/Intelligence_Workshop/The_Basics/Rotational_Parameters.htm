<h1>Rotational Parameters</h1>
<p>The &quot;Rotational&quot; parameters are AX, AY, and AZ. These parameters are used to rotate an object. It is very rare to write a formula to rotate a Part, as once you have the Part in an Assembly and rotated into the proper position, you normally don&#39;t need the angle of rotation to change. However, it is important to understand how Parts are rotated, because when Parts are rotated it changes the position of <span style="font-weight: bold;">the reference point</span> for the Part.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">AX = the angle of rotation around the X-axis</p>
<p>The X-axis of rotation moves a Part around the X-axis in the same fashion as a gymnast swings around a horizontal bar. Or you could think of it as holding a pencil with the tip pointing to the right so that the length of the pencil is running left and right. You then roll the pencil with you fingers; this is rotation in the AX.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">AY = the angle of rotation around the Y-axis</p>
<p>The Y-axis of rotation moves a Part around the Y-axis in the same fashion as the rope of a tether-ball swings around a pole. Or you could think of it as holding a pencil with the tip pointing up so the length of the pencil is running up and down. You then roll the pencil with your fingers; this is rotation in the AY.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">AZ = the angle of rotation around the Z-axis</p>
<p>The Z-axis of rotation moves a part around the Z-axis in the same fashion as a propeller rotates on an airplane as you face it. Or you could think of it as holding a pencil with the tip pointing at you so that the length of the pencil is running from front to back. You then roll the pencil with you fingers; this is rotation in the AZ.</p>
