  <h1>Tracing Through The Tree</h1>
  <p>If I asked you what the height of a Cabinet was you might say 34 1/2&quot;. This is correct as far as it goes. But to tell the computer what height the Cabinet is, is done a little differently. To tell the computer how high the Cabinet is, you would say <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.DY</span>.</p>
  <p>If you wanted to subtract the thickness of the Deck from the height of the Cabinet you would say 34 1/2 – 3/4 = 33 3/4&quot;. To tell the computer <span style="font-style: italic;">the height of the Cabinet minus the thickness of the deck</span>, we would say <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.DY - CAB.CASE.DE.DZ</span>. To come up with this information you need to trace it through the Object Tree. See the following picture. Let&#39;s take <span style="font-style: italic;">the height of the Cabinet minus the thickness of the Deck</span> and trace it through the tree. First we want the height of the Cabinet.</p>
  <p>Open the Object Tree (see <a href="The_Object_Tree.htm">Object Tree &quot;Assembly Level&quot;</a>) and click on the Cabinet to highlight it. Then look down at the lower pane and the parameter for the height of the Cabinet is &quot;DY&quot;. So the height of the Cabinet is <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.DY</span>.  The very top level of the Object Tree (when you are dealing with an Assembly) is called <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB</span>. It doesn&#39;t matter what the name of the Assembly is, for formulas it is called <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB</span>.</p>

  <p>Next get the thickness of the Deck. Open the Object Tree up even more until you find the Deck. Starting at the top (CAB) and working your way down, the thickness of the Deck is <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.CASE.DE.DZ</span>.</p>

  <p>Where are we coming up with those periods? Well every time the tree branches we add a &quot;period&quot;. Notice that in the case of the Deck it starts at the top (<span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB</span>) and then it branches at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case</span> so you add a period between the word <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB</span> and the word <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case</span>. Next it branches at the Deck so you add a period between <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">DE</span> and you have <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.CASE.DE</span>. From the Deck you move to the parameters in the bottom pane. <span style="font-style: italic;">Any time you move from the top pane to the bottom pane you add a period</span> so you must place a period between <span style="font-weight: bold;">DE</span> and the parameter <span style="font-weight: bold;">DZ</span> (DZ = thickness which is what you are looking for) and you have <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.CASE.DE.DZ</span>, which is the thickness of the Deck. So <span style="font-style: italic;">the height of the Cabinet minus the thickness of the deck</span> is equal to <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.DY-CAB.CASE.DE.DZ</span>.</p>
  <p>Say you wanted to know <span style="font-style: italic;">the width of the Adjustable Shelf minus the thickness of the Adjustable Shelf Strip</span>. First you would open up the Object Tree until you found the Adjustable Shelf. See the following picture. If you trace the first part, <span style="font-style: italic;">the width of the Adjustable Shelf</span> through the tree you come up with <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.INTERIOR.AS.DX</span>. If you trace the second part through the tree you come up with <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.INTERIOR.AS.SS.DZ</span>. Putting these two together you come up with <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.INTERIOR.AS.DX – CAB.INTERIOR.AS.SS.DZ</span>.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image1127.png"/></p>
  <p>So how does <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.INTERIOR.AS.DX – CAB.INTERIOR.AS.SS.DZ</span> work?  Well, it is like a road map for CABINET VISION. The first part <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.INTERIOR.AS.DX</span> leads CABINET VISION to the DX parameter of the &quot;AS&quot; (Adjustable Shelf), which in this case has a value of 22 23/32 inches. The second part <span style="font-weight: bold;">CAB.INTERIOR.AS.SS.DZ</span> leads CABINET VISION to the DZ parameter of the &quot;SS&quot; (Adjustable Shelf Strip), which has a value of 3/4 inches. The whole thing basically tells CABINET VISION 22 23/32 – 3/4 = 21 31/32.</p>
