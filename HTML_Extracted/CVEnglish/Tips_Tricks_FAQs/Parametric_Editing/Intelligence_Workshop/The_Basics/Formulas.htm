  <h1>Formulas</h1>
  <p>I hope you didn&#39;t skip ahead to this section. You really need to understand everything that comes before this or you will be lost. Writing a formula is actually fairly simple, the two basic steps are:</p>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Figure out what it is you are trying to do (this is your formula) and write it down (this is the hard part).</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Trace it through the Object Tree to get your code (this is the easy part).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="../../../../assets/images/image1124.png"/></p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Formula Names</p>
  <p>Notice how in the above picture, after the names of the Parts, it has letters in brackets; for the &quot;Finished Left End&quot; is says LF, for the &quot;Finished Right End&quot; it says RF, for the &quot;Unfinished Back&quot; it says UB, for the &quot;Deck&quot; it says DE, and for the &quot;Top&quot; it says TO.</p>
  <p>These letters in brackets are the names you will be using when you write formulas. In your formula if you wanted to refer to the &quot;Deck&quot;, of a Base Cabinet, you would refer to it using &quot;DE&quot; not &quot;Deck&quot;. If you wanted to refer to the Top you would use &quot;TO&quot; not &quot;Top&quot;.</p>
