<h1>Adding the Left Skirt</h1>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on the Face ortho view tab.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on &quot;New Part&quot;.  In the &quot;Part Type&quot; area select &quot;Skirt&quot; as the part type.  Under the &quot;Material&quot; area it should have a board stock listed (some kind of lumber would be perfect).  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">In the &quot;Size&quot; window set the size of this part to 24&quot;L and 1.5&quot;W.  Leave the thickness alone.  This part is the left skirt of the wood top and its length will be what ever the depth of the cabinet is.  We are going to let this piece and the front piece overlap each other, as we would most likely miter the side skirt into the front skirt if we were to build this wood top.  The width of this part is whatever the height of the cabinet is.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">In the &quot;Orientation&quot; window leave the orientation set to &quot;Front&quot;.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">In the &quot;Finish&quot; window check to see that the finish is set to &quot;Exterior&quot; for the front, back, and edges.  Click on the &quot;Finish&quot; button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You will now be at a Face ortho view and in the sidebar the &quot;Left/Right&quot; will be &quot;-15 inches&quot;.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Set the &quot;Left/Right&quot; to 0&quot; and press enter.  This will move the part so that it is inside of the empty cabinet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We now need to rotate this part so that the length is going front, to back, and the width is going up and down.  My first thought when rotating this part would be to rotate it on the Y-axis –90 (so the face was pointing to the left) and then rotate it on the X-axis +90 so that it was lying down (with the length running front to back).  This would place the reference point in the right, top and back corner. However when you rotate a part in an object (cabinet or another part), you always want to try and keep the reference point as close to the left, bottom, and back corner of the object as you can. As this will cut down on the number of placement formulas you have to write.  Also it doesn&#39;t really matter (in this case) if the back of this part is facing out, as the material is lumber.</p>
<p>There is a way to rotate this part so that it is rotated and placed to be the left skirt of our wood top, and yet the reference point would remain in the left, bottom, and back corner.</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">See if you can rotate this part so that its reference point stays where it was when the part was brought in (The left, bottom, and back corner).  And yet it is rotated in the correct direction.  If you get the rotation really hosed up click on the &quot;Remove Rotation&quot; button and try again.  If you get the rotation right you will not have to write any formulas for the placement of this part.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This part is now placed and rotated correctly.  We are now ready to place the right hand skirt.  Instead of adding a new part, we can just copy the part we have already placed.</p>
