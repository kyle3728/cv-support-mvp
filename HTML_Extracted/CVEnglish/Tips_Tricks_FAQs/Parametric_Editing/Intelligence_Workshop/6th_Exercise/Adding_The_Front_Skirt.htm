<h1>Adding The Front Skirt</h1>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on the Face ortho view tab.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on &quot;New Part&quot;, in the &quot;Part Type&quot; area select &quot;Skirt&quot; as the part type, then click &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">In the &quot;Size&quot; window set the size of this part to 30&quot;L and 1.5&quot;W.  Leave the thickness alone.  This part is the front skirt of the wood top and its length will be what ever the width of the cabinet is.  We are going to let this piece and the sidepieces overlap each other, as we would most likely miter the side skirts into the front skirt if we were to build this wood top.  The width of this part is whatever the height of the cabinet is.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">In the &quot;Orientation&quot; window leave the orientation set to &quot;Front&quot;.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">In the &quot;Finish&quot; window check to see that the finish is set to &quot;Exterior&quot; for the front, back, and edges.  Click on the &quot;Finish&quot; button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You will now be at the Face ortho view and in the sidebar the &quot;Left/Right&quot; will be &quot;-15 inches&quot;.</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Set the &quot;Left/Right&quot; to 0&quot; and press enter.  This will move the part so that it is inside of the empty cabinet.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">As you can see the part is running up and down.  We need to tip the part to the right so that the length is going from left to right.  Click on the part and rotate it so that it is running from left to right.  Remember to keep the reference point as close to where it was, as possible.  Answer, enter –90 in the rotation.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">As you can see, because of where the reference point is, this part is placed to low.  Enter 1.5&quot; in the &quot;Up/Down&quot; window and press enter.  This part will be placed up and down (Y) at whatever the height of the cabinet happens to be.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">If you look at the wood top from a 3D view by clicking on the 3D tab. You will notice that this part is in the back of the wood top.  We want it to be in the front, so move it to the front.  Answer; enter 23.25&quot; in the &quot;In/Out&quot; window.  Because of where the reference point for this part is located this part will be placed in and out (Z) at whatever the depth of the cabinet is minus the thickness of the front skirt, or whatever the width (DX) of the wood top is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All the parts are now rotated and placed correctly, so we will now give them intelligence.  Lets start with the wood top, then the left skirt, then the right skirt and then the front skirt.</p>
