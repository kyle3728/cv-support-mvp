<h1>Fourth Exercise</h1>
<p>This time we will add a board in the upper right hand opening.  It will run from the bottom of board@1 to the top of board@3.  It will be centered in the opening left to right.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/image1142.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" width="355" height="330" border="0"/></p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on the &quot;Face&quot; <img src="../../../../assets/images/image181.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" width="45" height="21" border="0"/> ortho view tab, and then click on the &quot;New Part&quot; button.  When the &quot;add a new part&quot; screen comes up, under the &quot;Part Type&quot; area select &quot;Board&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Click on &quot;Next&quot;.  This will bring you to the &quot;Size&quot; tab.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">If you where to measure the distance from the bottom of BOARD@1 to the top of BOARD@3 it would be 10 3/8&quot;.  The length of board@4 is equal to the length of board@2 divided by two minus the width of board@3 divided by two.  Or the length of board@4 is equal to the length of board@2 minus the width of board@3 then the remainder divided by two.  So set the length to 10 3/8&quot;, set the &quot;Width&quot; to 4&quot;.  Leave the thickness alone.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">On the &quot;Orientation&quot; tab select &quot;Front&quot; orientation.  Click on &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">You should now be at the &quot;Finish&quot; tab.  For this demonstration the finish doesn&#39;t matter.  Click on the &quot;Finish&quot; button.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">We now need to place the part &quot;Left/Right&quot; in the cabinet.  If your cabinet is still 36&quot; wide, and you have done everything you were supposed to up till now, the &quot;Left/Right&quot; would be 25 5/8&quot;.  The X for board@4 is equal to the left and right of BOARD@3 + 1/2 the Length of BOARD@3 - 1/2 the width of BOARD@4.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">We now need to place the part &quot;Up/Down&quot; if your cabinet is still 34 1/2&quot; high and you have done everything you were supposed to up till now the &quot;Up/Down&quot; will be 19 3/8&quot;.  The up and down of Board@4 is the same as the up and down of BOARD@3.</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">It now needs to move to the front of the cabinet (24 - .75 = 23.25), so we enter 23 1/4&quot; were it says &quot;In/Out&quot; and press enter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The part is now rotated and positioned correctly and we are ready to give the part intelligence.</p>
