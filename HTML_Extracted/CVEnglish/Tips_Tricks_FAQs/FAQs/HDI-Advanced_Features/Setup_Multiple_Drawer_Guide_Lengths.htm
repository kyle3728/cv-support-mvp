  <h1>Setup Multiple Drawer Guide Lengths</h1>
  <p>How do I properly setup multiple Drawer Guide Length selection?</p>
  <p>First off Drawer Guide length is based off of the Drawer Boxes Depth not the Cabinets Depth. The first step in the process is to verify that <a href="../../Drawers_Roll_Outs/SL_Drawer_Box_Sizing.htm">Drawer Box Depths</a> are being calculated correctly. If they are not it does not matter how you setup the Drawer Guide lengths. Once you have verified that the Depths of the Drawer Boxes are correct then focus on the Drawer Guide Lengths.</p>
  <p>Make sure that the Parent guide is set to the shortest length you would use. Then set each increment above that down the line.</p>
  <p>Parent --- Accuride 12&quot;</p>
  <p>&gt;= 14  --- Accuride 14”</p>
  <p>&gt;= 16  --- Accuride 16”</p>
  <p>&gt;= 18  --- Accuride 18”</p>
  <p>&gt;= 20  --- Accuride 20”</p>
  <p>&gt;= 22  --- Accuride 22”</p>
  <p>&gt;= 24  --- Accuride 24”</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none;"/></span> The Greater Than or Equal to references the Drawer Box Depth. A Drawer Box Depth, in the above scenario, Greater than or Equal to 14” would utilize the Accuride 14” Drawer Guide.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that it uses the Parent if the other conditions are not met, in this case a Drawer Box depth that is less than 14” would utilize the Parent, in this case Accuride 12”. If I had my Parent setup as Accuride 22” it would place a 22” guide on Drawer Box Depths less than 14”. As you can see setting the Parent wrong can cause problems.</p>
  <p>The key here is to verify that the Drawer Box depths are correct first. Then focus on the Guide Schedules. If you follow these basic &quot;guide&quot; lines you shouldn&#39;t have any problems.</p>
