  <h1>Add Lights to My Room for the Proper Effect</h1>
  <p>We have had trouble <a href="../../../Room_Level/Side_Bar/RLSB_Lights.htm">lighting</a> 3-D views of rendered drawings. When placing lights to highlight certain areas of Room we often wash out the color of the Cabinet, Wall, and/or Floor. We have tried
    to dim lights but do not get the desired effect. Is there a rule of thumb or basic plan to help us learn how to place lights correctly?</p>
  <p>Here are some helpful tips for setting up lighting:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Instead of trying to light a Room as it would be in &quot;real&quot; life, imagine that it is instead a stage. When the light is red - it is a &quot;spot&quot; light. A &quot;spot&quot; light is a much more intense light and will wash out a scene
        easily. We recommend switching your general lights to &quot;directional&quot; lights (blue in color) on the &quot;beam&quot; tab. Use these directional lights to fill the light in the Room and the spot light to highlight areas that you want to
        draw attention to. &quot;Spot&quot; lights also seem to always wash out light colored finishes, so stick with &quot;directional&quot; lights in that situation.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Start by placing only 2 lights - one on the left pointed right, and one on the right pointed left. Set them at about eye level (60&quot; to 65&quot;) and vary the angles of each. This will help to create nice shadows. Test these until you are happy,
        then save them in a light schedule.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Do all of this before you place a lot of &quot;extra fancy&quot; objects such as toasters etc. These will slow your rendering time down drastically. If you have a Job you have already done this too - just copy it to a new Room and delete the detailed
        items. You can save the light schedule to use in other Rooms and delete the copied Room when you are done.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">The more lights you add the slower the rendering time. So only add a few more lights to draw attention or to create an effect - such as light through a window, under counter lighting, or light in a glass cabinet.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Hopefully these few tips will help shed some “light” on Rendering.</p>
