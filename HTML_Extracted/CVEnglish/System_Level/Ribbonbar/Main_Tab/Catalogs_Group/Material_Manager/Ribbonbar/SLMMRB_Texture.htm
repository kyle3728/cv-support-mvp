  <h1><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image1696.png"/> Texture</h1>
  <p>A Texture is a pattern that will appear on your finished objects such as wood grain or any other visible feature. Textures will generally show through the Finish color in a Room adding the element of realism to your objects. Typically, Textures are black and white, and receive color from a Finish at the Room Level, however, this is not always the case. A Texture can be a sample of Marble, complete with the color and pattern that you choose to scan into Solid for use in your presentations. You will have to experiment with scanning in order to find the size and type of acceptable (scannable) images that do not distort when you shrink them to the size necessary to appear on a scaled Solid rendering. A hint that may help is to search for books from hobbyists who create miniature items. Examples might be doll house publications, model railroad publications, etc. Typically, the textures you will find there are created at the scale they will be rendered at, and do not need to be reduced, and do not suffer the distortion that often accompanies the reduction process.</p>

You will be presented with the following Properties window.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image2710.png"/></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">See the Working Area (List View) area of this topic below for more information on Texture Properties.</p>
  <h2>Sidebar</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Search_Pane" id="Search_Pane"></a>Search Pane -</span> See the <a href="../SLMM_Sidebar.htm#Search_Pane">Material Manager Sidebar</a> topic for more information.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Category_Pane" id="Category_Pane"></a>Category Pane -</span> See the <a href="../SLMM_Sidebar.htm#Group_Pane">Material Manager Sidebar</a> topic for more information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> There is one additional Right Click option here specific to Texture Categories and that is the Show Model Folder. After selecting this the Model folder will be available which will allow you to browse Textures which were associated to any <a href="../../../../../../Room_Level/Ribbonbar/Utilities_Tab/RL_Import_SketchUp_Model.htm">Sketchup Models</a> you have imported which included images.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/image6290.gif" style="border: none;"/> <img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image434.png"/></p>
  <h2>Working Area (List View)</h2>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image432.png"/></p>
  <p>Following are the Texture Properties available in the Working Area (List View):</p>
  <p><strong>ID -</strong> The internal database ID for the Texture (This value can not be edited).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name -</span> The Name of the Texture (This value can be edited).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description -</span> The Description of the Texture (This value can be edited).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Path -</span> The Path to the file the Texture is using (This value can not be edited).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">World Width -</span> The Width the image should represent in a real-world dimension.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">World Height -</span> The Height the image should represent in a real-world dimension.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decal -</span> If Enabled this will instruct CABINET VISION to not blend the Finish with the Texture.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tile -</span> If Enabled instructs CABINET VISION to repeat Texture at the specified World Width/World Height across the surface it is being applied to.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;">The Bitmap Method</p>
  <p>Here, a new Texture created using the Paint program that ships with Microsoft Windows™ will be imported for use as speaker cloth on Doors for a Job. The Texture was created in the favored 200 by 200 pixel size, and saved as a Bitmap file to the to my Windows Desktop folder as spk.bmp.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Warning.png" style="margin-left: 64px"/> Make sure that the image file you are importing is located somewhere other than where you are importing it to. In the above example the image file is on the Windows Desktop.</p>
  <p>To add a Texture choose the Category where you want it located then click the New option in the ribbonbar and select the Bitmap or JPG file from the Graphics sub-folder where you saved the file you made. Files that you copy to your computer can be saved to the same folder as those you make and imported in the same fashion.</p>
  <p>Since this is a file that exists on my computer I will choose the &quot;Load an image from a file&quot; option in the toolbar.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image435.png"/></p>
  <p>Browse to, and select you image file then click Open.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image436.png"/></p>
  <p>Go ahead and fill out all the Properties, when you are happy with the Properties click the Save option in the toolbar.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image437.png"/></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;Decal&quot;</span> check box, must be checked if you want the Texture to stand alone, I.E., not to be tinted by the Room Finish.</p>
  <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">&quot;Tile&quot;</span> check box should be enabled if you want the pattern to repeat on your object. Without checking this box, the Texture will appear one time, and may not cover all the surfaces you have applied it to. Make sure to set the World Width and World Height at 12 each. After verifying the appearance of your new Texture you can adjust these World dimensions to tweak the appearance of the Texture when displayed.</p>
  <p>To add this Texture to a Door as speaker cloth, create the speaker cloth as a &quot;<a href="Properties/Material_Types/SLMMP_Miscellaneous.htm">Miscellaneous</a>&quot; Material in the <a href="../SL_Material_Manager.htm">Material Manager</a>, and choose the new Texture for the face Texture. From the <a href="../../Material_Schedule_Manager/SLMSM_Doors.htm">Door Material Schedules</a>, create a Schedule referencing the Material as one with speaker cloth (Birch/Spker) and assign the speaker cloth to the &quot;Flat Panel&quot; category. You will see the following if viewed in High Detail in a Job. Note how the speaker cloth is not tinted by the Cabinet color and how the pattern repeats to fill each Door.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" height="516" src="../../../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/image878.bmp" style="border: none;" width="747"/></p>
  <p>The ultimate secret to successful Texture creation and usage is to experiment with the resolution and scale of the items you chose to use. You will quickly understand the relationship and how to improve the image after viewing your Textures in a practice Job. Textures are not limited to patterns, even company logos, initials, etc..., can be used.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> Textures can also be added from within a Job in the 3D View when selecting Textures to use in your Room or Assembly.</p>
