  <p style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; ">In the above view of the Assembly Manager, you see a Drawer Box Construction Method named &quot;5 Piece Drawer&quot; that uses a Five Piece Drawer Box <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">Style</span> of Construction.</p>

  <p>The Construction Style you select for your Construction Method is very important. This selection determines the Parts available for your Construction Method as well as options within each Part that are specific and necessary for the Style of Construction you need to configure. There are 5 possible Construction Styles.</p>

  <p>Typically, you would want to name your Construction Method something that indicates its contents, for example: If you only have one Five Piece Drawer Construction Method, then the name &quot;5 Piece Drawer&quot; would suffice. However, if you have several Five Piece methods, then your names should be more descriptive like &quot;5 Piece Dovetail,&quot; or &quot;5 Piece Miter.&quot;</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18pt;">How To Create a New Construction Method</p>
  <p>There are several ways to begin a new Construction Method. You could start with one of the Construction Methods that are pre-set in CABINET VISION and make modifications to them. You could copy one of the existing Construction Methods and then make changes to the copy so that it meets your requirements. Finally, you could create a brand new Construction Method by clicking on the Create a New Construction Method option . For the purposes of this example, we will create a brand new Construction Method because the options will be the same.</p>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.</span>  Click the Create New Construction Method option in the ribbonbar.  <img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image2353.png"/></p>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.</span> In the pop up window, give the Construction Method a name and select the Construction Style that should apply to this Construction Method. You should also select the Connection Machining to use for the options in the Connections area. Connection Machining is configured through the <a href="../../Connections/Connections.htm">Connection Manager</a>.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image2354.png"/></p>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.</span>  When you click OK, you will see the following window. Notice that the name of the Construction Method is &quot;My Five Piece&quot; and the Construction Style is &quot;Five Piece Drawer Box&quot;.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image2359.png"/></p>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.</span>  Next, you should begin to run through the Drawer Box Construction Method and answer the questions for each Part. Start by double clicking General. Double clicking on a Part (such as General) runs the Part Wizard for that Part. You can also run the Part Wizard for a part by clicking the branch to select it and then clicking the Modify option in the ribbonbar. You will then see the following window:</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image2356.png"/></p>
  <p>The Drawer Box Construction Method consists mainly of options that you may choose between. In our example, the first option that you must choose between is concerning the Cost of the Drawer Box.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none;"/></span></span> You will find that the pictures are very helpful tools when answering the Drawer Box questions. The pictures will change according to the choices that you make and they should give you an idea of what will happen in the Construction Method if certain choices are made. However, you should not be worried if the pictures don&#39;t match your Construction 100%. Simply choose the options that most closely resemble your Construction Method.</p>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.</span>  Then, simply go through the rest of the questions by answering them and then clicking Next. When you answer the final question in the branch, you can click the Finish button.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.</span>  When you finish the questions for the first Part, move on to the next one and answer the questions there.</p>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.</span>  Complete the Drawer Box Construction Method.</p>
  <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet"><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.</span>  Test your Construction Method in a Job. The easiest way to begin testing a Construction Method is to create a Job with a single Cabinet. Making sure that the overall size of the Drawer Box is one that you can easily work out a cut list for comparison. Also make sure that you are using a valid Drawer Box Material Schedule for this Job and that each part of the Drawer Box is made out of the correct Material.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none;"/></span></span> </span> Part thickness, which has a huge influence on the cut list, is controlled by the <a href="../../../Catalogs_Group/Material_Schedule_Manager/SLMSM_Drawer_Box.htm" target="_blank">Material Schedules</a> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">NOT</span> the Drawer Box Construction Method. Check each Part of this test Drawer Box and make sure that it is sized correctly. For any Parts that are incorrect, try to look at the orthographic views to determine where the problem lies.</p>
