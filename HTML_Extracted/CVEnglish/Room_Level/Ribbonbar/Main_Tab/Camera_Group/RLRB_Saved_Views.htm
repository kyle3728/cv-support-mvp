  <h1><img src="../../../../assets/images/image460.png"/> Saved Views</h1>
  <p>These options will allow you to work with any Saved Views you have created via the 3D View Right Click <a href="../../../Right_Click_Options/Right_Click_On_Screen/RLRC_On_Screen_3D.htm#Save_Camera">Save View</a> option.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image394.png"/> You can either use the drop down menu to select or use the Previous Saved and Next Saved options to scroll through your Saved views.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image395.png"/> The Edit Views option allows you to Delete any Views you no longer need in the Job.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image396.png"/> The Lock Orientation option keeps you from accidentally Rotating your view. Disable this option if you want to Rotate the Saved View. Note: Rotating the View with this option disabled does not re-save
    the View at the new Rotation. You would need to use Save View to save a new orientation.</p>
  <p><a id="Walk_Through"></a><img src="../../../../assets/images/image461.png"/>  The Edit Walk Through option allows you to string all, or some, of your Saved Views together into a Walk Through. CABINET VISION will create smooth seamless transitions from
    one Saved View to another. The left side of the Walk Through Manager will list all of your current Available Saved Views. Selecting and then moving  a Saved View to the right into the Walk Through pane will establish the Walk Through. You can move
    the Views arround in the list, controlling their order, by using the Move Up and Move Down arrows. The Walk Through created here will be used in +Tour.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image463.png"/></p>
  <p><img src="../../../../assets/images/image464.png"/> The Walk Through option allows you to &quot;Play&quot; the Walk Through you have created through the <strong>Edit Walk Through</strong> option. The Walk Through can be played in <a href="../View_Group/RL_Render_Mode.htm#WireMode">Wire Mode</a>,
    <a href="../View_Group/RL_Render_Mode.htm#FillMode">Fill Mode</a>, <a href="../View_Group/RL_Render_Mode.htm#TextureMode">Texture Mode</a> and if you have xRender it will also play in <a href="../../PhotoVision_Tab/RLRB_Render_Group.htm#Realtime">Realtime</a>.</p>
