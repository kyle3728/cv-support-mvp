  <h1>Setup Reports</h1>

  <p>Report Groups may be created to contain Reports that are similar to each other OR Report Groups could be created to contain all Reports needed for a certain type of Job.</p>
  <p>For example: If you build both Frameless and Face Frame Cabinets but the Reports that you use are different based on the Construction Style, you could create a Frameless Report Group that contained all Reports for Frameless Cabinets and a Face Frame
    Report Group that contains all Reports for Face Frame Cabinets. The advantage of this type of a setup is that when you are ready to print out the Reports you can simply use the <a href="../RLSBRC_Print_Reports_In_Group.htm">Print Reports In Group</a>    option to print all of the Reports in this group at one time.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt;">Creating a Report Group</p>
  <p>When you click Setup Reports, you will see the following screen:</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/image1133.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;"/></p>
  <p>This is a list of the Reports that are available in CABINET VISION. In the sidebar is a list of all of the Report Groups that have been created. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To create a new report group, simply click the Add button</span> and then
    enter the name that you want to use for this group. When you click OK the new group will be added to the list of Report Groups.</p>
  <p>After you have created your new Report Group, you will need to begin assigning Reports to that Group. To add a Report to a Group, click on that Report and then click the check box to add a check next to the desired Report Group. As you scroll down the
    right side of your screen you will notice that some of the Reports have a green CV icon in front of them. This green CV icon lets you know that the Report has been assigned to a Group. If you click on that Report you will see a check mark next to
    one or more of the Report &quot;Groups&quot; in the sidebar. Reports can be assigned to more than one group if you like.</p>
