  <p>When your Job is complete, the Report Center allows you to print information about your Job.</p>
  <p>The Report Center is also used to select, and organize your Reports into &quot;Report Groups&quot; that you create and maintain.  A Report Group is a collection of Reports organized under one heading or name. Using Report Groups makes it easy to print
    multiple Reports; you just select a &quot;Report Group&quot; to print, and then click on the &quot;Print Reports In Group&quot; button and all the Reports contained in that &quot;Report Group&quot; will print.</p>
  <p>While it is true that you can start printing information about your Job as soon as you have something laid out, as CABINET VISION comes preset up with sample <a href="Sidebar/Setup_Reports/RLSBRC_Setup_Reports.htm">Report Groups</a>. It is also true
    that those Report Groups might not contain the Reports you would like them too. Therefore you will have some preliminary setup work to do to customize the Report Center to your way of doing things.</p>
  <p>Once you have the Report Center setup to your satisfaction printing is just a matter of clicking on the &quot;Reports&quot; button then clicking on the &quot;Report Center&quot; button. You then select the &quot;Report Group&quot; to print and then
    click on the &quot;Print Reports In Group&quot; button.</p>
