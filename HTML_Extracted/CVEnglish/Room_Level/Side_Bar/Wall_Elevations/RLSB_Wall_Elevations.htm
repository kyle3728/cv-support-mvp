  <p>Plan and Elevation Sheets are special reports designed for your Installers. They will have a picture of a Wall Elevation, with a list of all the Assemblies that go on that Wall across the bottom of the printout, as well as other Job/Room/Wall information. See the <a href="RLSBWE_The_Wall_Elevations_Layout.htm">Plan &amp; Elevation Sheet Layout topic</a> for more information.</p>

  <p><img src="../../../assets/images/image1381.png"/></p>
  <p>You can access the Wall Elevations Layers to edit the content from the Reports area by right clicking on an open area and selecting Properties. The screen pictured above should then appear. This view is editable in the same way that you can make changes to <a href="../../Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/View_Group/Layers/RLLA_Assembly_Sheet.htm">Layers</a>. The printer icon will be used to determine whether that particular item is visible on the printed page. If the printer icon is lit, that item will appear, if it is dark, that item will not be printed. The color block can be used to determine the color that will be used for that item. The line type can be selected by clicking on the small sample line and then choosing a line type. Finally, some items will be editable. You can click on Shop Annotations, Annotations, or Dimensions and the edit button will become active. By clicking on Edit, you can control details of that item.</p>
