  <p>After selecting this feature, you will see your Room, with an outline around your Assemblies that are Classified as Base or Vanity and a red dashed outline that appears to be a Counter Top on one of the Walls. This red outline represents the Wall that is <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">active</span>. The <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">active</span> Wall is the Wall that the Counter Top is attached to in the hierarchy of CABINET VISION. If you draw a Counter Top with an active Wall other than the Wall the Counter Top is on, and later delete the Wall that was active, you will loose that Counter Top even though it appeared to be attached to a Wall that still exists. Always give thought to which Wall should be the active Wall when creating your Counter Tops.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/Warning.png" style="border: none;"/> Selecting the correct active Wall (the red outline) is <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">VERY</span> important. If you have a different Wall activated than the one you are drawing your Counter Top on you will not see your Counter Top in the proper Elevation view. Another <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">VERY</span> important point to note is when using the Bid Center and using the Bid Method <a href="Bid_Center/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Rate_Tables/RLSBBC_Bid_Methods.htm#PerLinealFootCounterTop">Per Lineal Foot of Counter Top</a> or <a href="Bid_Center/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Rate_Tables/RLSBBC_Bid_Methods.htm#PerLMCounterTop">Per Lineal Meter of Counter Top</a> the calculation is based on the active Wall. Not having the correct active Wall selected can cause <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ERRORS IN YOUR BID</span>.</p>
  <p>To change the active Wall, simply click in front of the Wall that you would like to be active. This works equally well on Wall faces and Wall backs.</p>

  <p>Creating Counter Tops for your Job requires choosing whether you would like to use the AutoBuild Tops sidebar button or build the Counter Tops using the New Top sidebar button. Simple plans, are easily accomplished using the AutoBuild feature. Click the AutoBuild button, then choose whether you wish the Counter Tops built for the entire Room, or just a single Wall. If you choose the single Wall option, be sure that you have selected the correct Wall as the active Wall.</p>
  <p>If you choose to use the New Top method, you will see the same outline with a reference to the active Wall as shown above, however, you will be required to use the Counter Top <a href="../../Tips_Tricks_FAQs/The_Shape_Editor/The_Shape_Editor.htm">Shape Editor</a> that will appear in the sidebar.</p>
  <p>It is possible to use both methods in a Job, however, if you choose to do so, you must build using the AutoBuild feature before building any Counter Tops by the New Top feature.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/Warning.png" style="border: none;"/> The AutoBuild feature will delete any existing Counter Tops in the current Room.</p>
  <p>The following graphic is an example of Counter Tops that would require being built using the New Top feature. Note the unique shapes involved, and the different Elevations.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" height="390" src="../../assets/images/zGraphics/Imported%20Graphics/image497.jpg" style="border: none;" width="473"/></p>
  <p>These Counter Tops were created, one at a time, using the New Top sidebar option. The image below shows the lower Counter Top with the edge attributes defined below.</p>
  <p><img src="../../assets/images/image654.png"/></p>
  <p>After the shape of the Counter Top was drawn, and the configuration completed, the edges were defined by selecting the edges and setting their <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edge</span> in the sidebar.</p>
  <p><img src="../../assets/images/image655.png"/></p>
  <h2>Edge - Automatic</h2>
  <p>The system will interrogate an automatically assign edge types.</p>
  <h2><a name="SelectUnfinishedEdges" id="SelectUnfinishedEdges"></a>Edge - Unfinished</h2>
  <p>This option specifies an Edge on a Counter Top to be Unfinished.</p>
  <h2><a name="SelectFinishedEdges" id="SelectFinishedEdges"></a>Edge Finished</h2>
  <p>This option specifies an Edge on a Counter Top to be Finished.</p>
  <h2><a name="SelectEdgesForEdgeProfiles" id="SelectEdgesForEdgeProfiles"></a>Edge Profile</h2>
  <p>This option specifies an Edge on a Counter Top to incorporate your selected <a href="../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/SL_Molding_Manager.htm">Counter Top Edge Profile</a>.</p>
  <h2><a name="SelectEdgesForSplash" id="SelectEdgesForSplash"></a>Edge Splash</h2>
  <p> This option specifies an Edge on a Counter Top to have a Splash.</p>
  <h2><a name="Butt_Edge" id="Butt_Edge"></a>Edge Butt</h2>
  <p>This option specifies an Edge on a Counter Top to have your specified <a href="../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Construction_Group/Assembly_Manager/Counter_Top/Branches/CTW_Joining.htm">Counter Top Joinery</a>.</p>
