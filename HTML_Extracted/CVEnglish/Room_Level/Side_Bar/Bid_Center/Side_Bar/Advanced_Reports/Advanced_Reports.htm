  <p>The Advanced Reports area is used to select, print, and organize your Reports into &quot;Report Groups&quot; that you create and maintain.  A Report Group is a collection of Reports organized under one heading or name. Using Report Groups makes it easy
    to print multiple Reports; you just select a &quot;Report Group&quot; to print, and then click on the &quot;Print Reports In Group&quot; button and all the Reports contained in that &quot;Report Group&quot; will print.</p>
  <p>While it is true that you can start printing Bid information about your Job as soon as you have something laid out, as Solid comes preset up with sample <a href="Advanced_Report_Group.htm">Report Groups</a>. It is also true that those Report Groups
    might not contain the Bid Reports you would like them too. Therefore you will have some preliminary setup work to do to customize the Advanced Reports area to your way of doing things.</p>
  <p>Once you have the Advanced Reports area setup to your satisfaction printing is just a matter of clicking on the &quot;Advanced Reports&quot; button. You then select the &quot;Report Group&quot; to print and then click on the &quot;Print Reports In Group&quot;
    button.</p>
