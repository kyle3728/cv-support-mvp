  <h1>Bid Methods</h1>
  <p>This is a list of the Bid Methods used by the Bid Center. The value that each item returns is typically multiplied by a value you enter during setup.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> New Bid Methods cannot be created by a user in CABINET VISION, nor can the existing ones be changed.  </p>
  <p>There are over one hundred Bid Methods plus any Custom Labor Schemes you have created, that you can select from; they are as follows:</p>
  <h2><a name="PercentMatCost" id="PercentMatCost"></a>% of Material Cost</h2>
  <p>This Bid Method takes the value you enter (Whole Number representing the Percentage) and multiplies it by the Total Cost of Materials used in the Job. Material Cost is returned and calculated from the highlighted settings below in the Material Manager.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image936.png"/></p>
  <p>Let’s break these highlighted areas down.</p>
  <p>First let’s start with the Default Markup and Default Tax Rate. The Default Tax Rate comes from the Tax Rate either entered here by you for the Material or is brought over by the <a href="../../../../../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Material_Manager/Ribbonbar/SLMM_Vendor.htm">Vendor</a>    selected for the Material. The Default Markup is either entered by you or brought over by the <a href="../../../../../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Material_Manager/Ribbonbar/Properties/SLMMRB_Vendors.htm">Vendor</a> selected for
    the Material.</p>
  <p>The Tax Rate percentage is only applied to individual Materials if the Sales Tax field is set to True for that Material. Typically, you will only select Tax for those Materials that &quot;you&quot; pay tax on. There is a separate area in the Bid Center
    to calculate the Tax your &quot;customer&quot; pays.</p>
  <p>The Default Cost field in the Materials Properties area represents the selected Units Cost. So, in the example above the Cost is per Sheet. This Cost is either entered by you or is brought over by the <a href="../../../../../../System_Level/Ribbonbar/Main_Tab/Catalogs_Group/Material_Manager/Ribbonbar/Properties/SLMMRB_Vendors.htm">Vendor</a>    selected for the Material.</p>
  <p>The example below represents one Sheet of the Material we have been looking at. In this case the price will come through to the Bid Center for one Sheet as:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: circle;">
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">1.00 Sheets x $17.00 = $17.00</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">2% Default Markup = $.34</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">0% Tax = $0.00 (Because Sales Tax is False)</p>
    </li>
    <li class="p">
      <p class="Indent_1_Bulllet">Total = $17.34</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The final Material Property that will affect % of Material Cost is the Waste field. The Waste Percentage entered for the Material in the Material Manager will be added, in this case, to the number of Sheets represented in the Job.</p>
  <h2><a name="PercentRunningTotal" id="PercentRunningTotal"></a>% of Running Total</h2>
  <p>This Bid Method will allow you to specify a % of the Running Total of the Bid Methods directly above it in the list of Bid Methods in the Rate Table.</p>

  <h2><a name="PercentSubTotal" id="PercentSubTotal"></a>% of Sub Total</h2>
  <p>This Bid Method will allow you to specify a % of the Subtotal of the Bid Method directly above it in the list of Bid Methods in the Rate Table.</p>

  <h2><a name="UseCabinetCatalogPricing" id="UseCabinetCatalogPricing"></a>Use Assembly Catalog Pricing</h2>
  <p>This Bid Method can be used to set an Up-charge or Discount to Assembly Pricing that is brought over to the Bid Center. By Default any Assembly that has a Value for Price in its Properties will come over and be added to the Bid by default. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This Bid Method, if used with no values, would actually double the Price values applied to the Assemblies.</span>    The best way to explain this Bid Method is by example. The image below represents what you would see with no active Rate Table and you bring in a Std Base with a Price of $100.00.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image950.png"/></p>
  <p>Without utilizing this Bid Method in your Rate Table there is no way to either Up-charge or Discount this price. The graphic below demonstrates how to use this Bid Method using the Markup field to give a 20% (-120 Markup) discount on the Assembly demonstrated
    above.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image952.png"/></p>
  <p>And here is the result:</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image951.png"/></p>
  <p>You could do a 20% Up-Charge utilizing the same Method. You would set the Markup to 80% instead.</p>
  <h2><a name="UseDoorCatalogPriceBidMethod" id="UseDoorCatalogPriceBidMethod"></a>Use Door Catalog Pricing</h2>
  <p>This Bid Method does not use the Value field. It takes the Prices you enter for Doors, Drawer Fronts, False Fronts, and Panels and their sub-components and totals them for the Job.</p>
  <p>There are several places where this data is retrieved.</p>
  <h4>Door Catalog</h4>
  <p>The first area where Door Catalog Pricing is retrieved is from the Door Styles Price fields. You can add a price either &quot;Per Door” or &quot;Per SqUnit” or even a combination of both. The highlighted portion of the image below shows these fields.</p>
  <p><img src="../../../../../../assets/images/image940.png"/></p>
  <h4>Door/Drawer Front Material Schedules</h4>
  <p>The next area where Door Catalog Pricing is retrieved is from the Material Schedule(s) assigned to the Door Style. You can add a price either Per Door (Cost/Door) or Per Square Foot or Meter (Cost/SqFt/SqM) or even a combination of both. These fields
    can be used to add Door Pricing Up-charges based on the Material(s) utilized by the Door Style. The highlighted portion of the image below shows these fields.</p>

  <p>Parts are also broken out for each Cabinet in the Catalog Level of the Bid Center.</p>
