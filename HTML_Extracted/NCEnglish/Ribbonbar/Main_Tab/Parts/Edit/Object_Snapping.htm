  <h1>Object Snapping</h1>
  <p>The S2M CENTER provides a special kind of cursor snap in addition to the typical grid snap. This allows the cursor to automatically snap to different hot-points on or adjacent to another object; for example, end-points, mid-points, center-points, and intersections. These locations are commonly referenced when creating or editing geometry. For most functions, the cursor will also snap to the origin of the object.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For example, you may want to create a line that is connected to the end of an arc. Start creating the line by locating the endpoint of the arc. When located, a round <a href="Object_Snapping.htm#Hot-Point_Markers">hot-point marker</a> appears on the arc endpoint.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image217.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Click the hot-point marker to start the line there. The start of the line snaps precisely to the end of the arc, connecting these objects end-to-end.</p>
  <p>You can choose what types of positions and conditions will automatically be located by enabling or disabling options in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../../Introduction/File_Menu/Preferences.htm#Tools_Tab">Preferences | Tools</a></span>.</p>

  <p>Ignores snap to Grid and Points, and leaves the Smart-Lines angle snap on.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Keyboard/shift_key.png" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>Activates the &quot;full grid snap&quot; mode, forcing snap to the Grid over a position just aligned with a Point.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/zGraphics/Keyboard/ctrl_key.png" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p>Completely ignores snap, including Smart-Lines.</p>
  <h2>Dynamic Snapping</h2>
  <p>The S2M CENTER also has the ability to Snap Dynamically (also known as Assumptive Snapping). When you are in line with a Snap Point on another Object within the Drawing space the S2M CENTER will project that position to your location. When this projection along with the associated <a href="Object_Snapping.htm#Hot-Point_Markers">hot-point marker</a> is displayed you can be assured that the Object will be placed in-line with that Objects Snap Point.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For Example you would like to draw two line Parallel to each other. After drawing the first line simply move your cursor in-line with the first lines Start Point and you will see a Snap Line projection assuring you they are in-line.</p>

  <h2><a name="Hot-Point_Markers" id="Hot-Point_Markers"></a>Hot-Point Markers</h2>
  <p>When the cursor moves over a valid snap location, the located position displays with a hot-point marker and a special cursor appears to identify the type of location.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> The system will not display a hot-point marker for a particular location type if it is disabled in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../../Introduction/File_Menu/Preferences.htm#Tools_Tab">Preferences | Tools</a></span>.</p>
  <p>The list below identifies these special cursors:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image219.gif" style="border: none; cursor: nwse-resize;"/>  Cursor is snapping to one of the extremities (End Point) of an object.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image220.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Cursor is snapping to the middle position (Mid Point) of an object.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image221.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Cursor is snapping to the center of an arc or circle.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image222.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Cursor is snapping to the intersection of two objects.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image227.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Cursor has one coordinate aligned with any of the snap points.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image224.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Editing CAD line is extending along the original angle.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image236.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Editing CAD line is snapping to one of the smart line angles.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image238.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Editing CAD line has a locked angle.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image265.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Cursor is snapping to any of the points in the editing shape.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image273.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Cursor is snapping to the grid.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="../../../../assets/images/image247.gif" style="border: none;"/>  Cursor is snapping to the origin (0,0 position) in the view.</p>
