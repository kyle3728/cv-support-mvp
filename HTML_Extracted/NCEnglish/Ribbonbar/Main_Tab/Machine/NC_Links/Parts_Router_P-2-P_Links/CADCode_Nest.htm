<h1>CADCode Nest</h1>
<p>This is a Parts Router and/or Point-to-Point Link.</p>
<p>CADCode does not support tool compensation for saws. All saw tools should be set to output Center Line paths. CADCode does support tool compensation for routers and recommends setting routers to output with tool compensation. The following information from the Tool Catalog can not be used by CADCode and is therefore ignored: Descent Rate and Maximum Depth Per Pass. Layer names will be generated automatically to the following settings:</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p class="1_List">Panel Dimensions: PANEL</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="1_List">Routing: ROUTE_T + Tool Number + F + Feed Rate + Tool Comp</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="1_List">Grooving Operations:  GROOVE_T + Tool Number (If not 0)</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="1_List">Vertical Boring: VBORE_T + Tool Number (If Not 0)</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p class="1_List">Horizontal Boring: HBORE_T + Tool Number (If Not 0)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Routers and Saws are selected by the Tool Number in the layer name. Be sure to have accurate tool numbers for all routers and saws in the Tool Catalog. If the Tool Number for a drill is 0, tool selection is made be a size match with a tool Diameter. You can call any tool by number in CADCode, including drills. However, there are several reasons to use Diameter rather than number, but there are occasions where you may want a specific drill number or sequence. In a layered file, each unique drill would require a separate layer, i.e. &quot;VBORE_T12.&quot;  Since you are specifying a specific tool CADCode cannot optimize the sequence or multiple drops and this tool is therefore removed from the optimization process.  One reason you might wish a specific tool would be if you have a 5mm through bit or countersink that you want instead of a dowel bit.  Tool depth has been eliminated from the layer name since CADCode reads the information directly from the 3D position of each entity.  Additional description layers have been added for labeling capabilities.</p>
