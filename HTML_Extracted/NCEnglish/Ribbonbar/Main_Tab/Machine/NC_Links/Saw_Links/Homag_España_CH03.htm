<h1>Homag España CH03</h1>
<p>This is a <span class="glossterm">Panel Saw</span> Link.</p>
<p>This link is for the Homag España CH03 for the Master TRIA 460 Controller.  This is an unofficial file format since there is no way to communicate to the saw the cut type for each instruction.  For that reason the following rules must be followed to ensure cuts are made in the correct sequence.  The 1st rule is that you must optimize for Labor which will limit the output to 3rd phase cuts.  The 2nd rule is that the last strip out will be the first strip back in.  With a pattern with rips, cross-cuts and 3rd phase cuts, the rips are cut first.  The final rip will be put back into the saw first for cross cuts.  The last cross cut will be fed back into the saw first for 3rd phase cuts.  The 3rd rule is that there will always be an absolute cut when feeding a new piece of material into the saw.</p>
