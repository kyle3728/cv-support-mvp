  <h1>Dynamic Snapping</h1>
  <h1>Object Snapping</h1>
  <p>The S2M CENTER provides a special kind of cursor snap in addition to the typical grid snap. This allows the cursor to automatically snap to different hot-points on or adjacent to an object; for example, end-points, mid-points, center-points, and intersections. These locations are commonly referenced when creating or editing geometry. For most functions, the cursor will also snap to the origin of the object.</p>
  <p class="hcp1">For example, you may want to create a line that is connected to the end of an arc. Start creating the line by locating the endpoint of the arc. When located, a round <a href="Dynamic_Snapping.htm#HotPointMarkers">hot-point</a> marker appears on the arc endpoint.</p>
  <p class="hcp1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image767.gif" style="border: none;"/></p>
  <p class="hcp1">Click the hot-point marker to start the line there. The start of the line snaps precisely to the end of the arc, connecting these objects end-to-end.</p>
  <p>You can choose what types of positions and conditions will automatically be located by enabling or disabling options in <span class="hcp3" style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Preferences.htm#Tools_Tab">Preferences | Tools Tab</a></span>.</p>

  <h2>Dynamic Snapping</h2>
  <p class="hcp4">Solid also has the ability to Snap Dynamically (also known as Assumptive Snapping). When you are in line with a Snap Point on another Object within the Drawing space the S2M CENTER will project that position to your location. When this projection along with the associated <a href="Dynamic_Snapping.htm#HotPointMarkers">hot-point marker</a> is displayed you can be assured that the Object will be placed in-line with that Objects Snap Point.</p>
  <p class="hcp1">For Example you would like to draw two line Parallel to each other. After drawing the first line simply move your cursor in-line with the first lines Start Point and you will see a Snap Line projection assuring you they are in-line.</p>

  <h2><a name="HotPointMarkers" id="HotPointMarkers"></a>Hot-point Markers</h2>
  <p>When the cursor moves over a valid snap location, the located position displays with a hot-point marker and a special cursor appears to identify the type of location.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/zGraphics/Extras/Information.png" style="border: none;"/> The system will not display a hot-point marker for a particular location type if it is disabled in <span class="hcp3" style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Preferences.htm#Tools_Tab">Preferences | Tools Tab</a></span>.</p>
  <p>The list below identifies these special cursors:</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image769.gif" style="border: none;"/> Cursor is snapping to one of the extremities (End Point) of an object.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image770.gif" style="border: none;"/> Cursor is snapping to the middle position (Mid Point) of an object.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image771.gif" style="border: none; cursor: nesw-resize;"/> Cursor is snapping to the center of an arc or circle.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image772.gif" style="border: none;"/> Cursor is snapping to the intersection of two objects.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image773.gif" style="border: none;"/> Cursor has one coordinate aligned with any of the snap points.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image774.gif" style="border: none;"/> Editing CAD line is extending along the original angle.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image775.gif" style="border: none;"/> Editing CAD line is snapping to one of the smart line angles.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image779.gif" style="border: none;"/> Editing CAD line has a locked angle.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image778.gif" style="border: none;"/> Cursor is snapping to any of the points in the editing shape.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image777.gif" style="border: none;"/> Cursor is snapping to the grid.</p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/image780.gif" style="border: none;"/> Cursor is snapping to the origin (0,0 position) in the view.</p>
