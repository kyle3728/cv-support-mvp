  <p>When viewing Patterns this option will allow printing of Pattern diagrams for your Machine Operator which includes a graphic representation of the Pattern, a list of Parts, Program Name and bar code for the Pattern (If a Nest).</p>
  <p>With Nested output the print-out also indicates how the Material should be loaded on the Machine.</p>
  <p style="color: #800000;">In the example below, the material being machined is a &quot;one-sided&quot; material with different &quot;sides&quot; (a face-dependent material which has different textures on the material back/unfinished face and material front/finished face). In
    this example, the nest CNC program machining face indicator is indicating that the material should be loaded &quot;Particle Board&quot; side down for proper nest CNC program machining. &quot;Particle Board&quot; is the name of a texture ascribed to
    only one of the two &quot;sides&quot; of the material &quot;1/4 1s Melamine.&quot;</p>

  <p style="color: #0000ff;">In the example below, the material being machined is a &quot;two-sided&quot; material with identical &quot;sides&quot; (a non-face-dependent material which has identical textures on both the material back/unfinished face and material front/finished
    face). As such, no nest CNC program machining face indicator is present since one is not required for proper nest CNC program machining.</p>
